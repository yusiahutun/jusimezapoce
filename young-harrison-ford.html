Before achieving fame and recognition, a young Harrison Ford described himself as a “late bloomer” and took a drama class in the final quarter of his senior year at Wisconsin’s Ripon College to get over his shyness.</p><p>Though he ultimately dropped out and married his college sweetheart Mary Marquardt in 1964, those acting lessons certainly paid off, as he soon began acting in local plays and worked his way up to bit parts in movies. His earliest roles, in movies like 1966’s Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round and 1967’s Luv were so small they went uncredited, but he’d soon get his first-ever screen credit (as “Harrison J. Ford” — though Ford didn’t actually have a middle name, this was meant to avoid a mixup with a silent film actor with the same name) in the Western A Time for Killing.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-607405554-edited.jpg><p>TV came calling throughout the late ’60s and early ’70s, as Ford appeared in episodes of Gunsmoke, Ironside, The F.B.I. and several other popular shows.&nbsp;Unhappy with the roles he was being offered, Ford became a self-taught professional carpenter with a celebrity client list (including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">writer Joan Didion</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">musician Sergio Mendes</a>).&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-607405004.jpg><p>But in the early 1970s, Ford finally got his big break and soon starred in some of the most iconic moments on the silver screen of the last 60 years. He’s since starred in more than 40 films. Here’s a look back at some of young Harrison Ford’s most notable TV shows, movies and moments over the years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1973: American Graffiti</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-176224688.jpg><p>In 1973, Ford played Bob Falfa, a drag racer in early-’60s California, in American Graffiti, the second movie directed by George Lucas. Working with Lucas would be pivotal for Ford’s career, as the director hired him just a few years later for his first starring role, in a little 1977 movie known as Star Wars. The rest is space-opera history, and Ford became known as one of Hollywood’s coolest, most charismatic leading men.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1977: Star Wars</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-607402182.jpg><p>As the swaggering space icon Han Solo, Ford became a household name, and Star Wars became one of the most successful movies of all time, spawning a major franchise and changing Hollywood — and pop culture&nbsp;— forever.</p><p>By the time he was cast as Han Solo, Harrison Ford was already in his 30s — which is young in the real world but considered a late start in Hollywood. When it comes to aging, Ford takes a philosophical and humorous approach.&nbsp;“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I’m like old shoes</a>,” he’s said — as a late bloomer, he had time to come into his own without growing up in public or being seen as a flavor of the month.</p><p>In fact, not being an overnight success worked in Ford’s favor. “I was 35 when I first hit with Star Wars.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I had some degree of maturity and some degree of experience, yet physically I still looked young</a>,” he told Empire Magazine. “That had been an impediment early on in my career, but then it turned out to be an advantage.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1980: The Empire Strikes Back</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-607402374-edited.jpg><p>The dazzling success of Star Wars spawned multiple sequels, and in 1980, Ford reprised the role of Han Solo in Star Wars: Episode V — The Empire Strikes Back.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1981: Raiders of the Lost Ark</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-607390388.jpg><p>In 1981, Ford played the title character in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Steven Spielberg’s thrilling tribute to ’30s adventure stories. Ford excelled as a smart, swashbuckling charmer and he’d play Indy five more times in the next four decades.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1982: Blade Runner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-482737303-edited.jpg><p>Harrison played Rick Deckard, a police officer in then-futuristic 2019 Los Angeles, in Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner. This moody, film noir-inspired sci-fi tale had a highly influential aesthetic, and is often considered one of the greatest films in the genre.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1983: Tying the knot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-3248718.jpg><p>After splitting from Marquardt in 1979, Ford married his second wife, Melissa Mathison, in 1983 a screenwriter who worked with Steven Spielberg on E.T. the Extraterrestrial. Ford and Mathison had two children but separated in 2000.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1985: Witness</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-505630087.jpg><p>In 1985, Ford starred as John Book, a detective protecting an&nbsp;Amish&nbsp;woman and her young son, in Witness. This intense dramatic role earned him Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1988: Working Girl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-607405488.jpg><p>In 1988, Ford played Jack Trainer, a dashing businessman, in Working Girl. The movie captured the spirit of the workplace striving in the ’80s, and showed Ford was just as memorable in a rom-com as a sci-fi movie. As he said in The Hollywood Reporter, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It was a tactic of mine at the time to look for something different to what I had lately done</a>,” and Working Girl let him do something new.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1992: Patriot Games</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-168597506.jpg><p>In 1992, Ford returned to an action-packed world in Patriot Games. He played Jack Ryan, a character created by writer Tom Clancy. Ryan has been the subject of many books and movies, and been played by leading men like Alec Baldwin, Ben Affleck, Chris Pine and John Krasinski in addition to Ford.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2002: The beginning of a long relationship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-1135474-edited.jpg><p>More action movies, like The Fugitive, Clear and Present Danger and Air Force One, followed in the ’90s. In the early ’00s, Ford reached a major milestone in his personal life, as he began dating Ally McBeal star Calista Flockhart after they met at the 2002 Golden Globe Awards.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2003: Getting his star</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-530056172-edited.jpg><p>In 2003, Harrison Ford was honored with a well-deserved star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2010: A second marriage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-95883681.jpg><p>In 2010, Ford and Flockhart married in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when Ford was filming Cowboys and Aliens.&nbsp; “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Romantic love is one of the most exciting and fulfilling kinds of love and I think there is potential for it at any stage in your life,</a>” Ford told Hello! Magazine.&nbsp;They have a son, Liam, whom Flockhart adopted in 2001.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2013: 42</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-166210054.jpg><p>In 2013, Ford played real-life Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey in 42, a historical sports drama starring the late Chadwick Boseman as Jackie Robinson. For the part, he wore a fat-suit and some facial prosthetics, which made him look very different from the dashingly handsome Ford we usually think of.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ford’s said this is one of his underrated roles</a>, and told Entertainment Weekly, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I was very anxious to play the part because I really connected with the character and I think the story is really important</a>.&nbsp;I loved the language of the guy; I loved his style.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2022: 1923</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/1923_ENVIRONMENTAL_02_JACOB_09252022_JM_0052RT_f.jpg><p>Ford started out in westerns and small TV roles decades ago, and in 2022 he’s came back to the small screen in a bigger role than ever before, starring in 1923. The series is a prequel to the popular Kevin Costner-starring Western Yellowstone, and Ford plays Jacob Dutton, a weathered and weary rancher, opposite Helen Mirren.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(Click here for<a href=#> jaw-dropping photos of Helen Mirren when she was young</a> and how <a href=#>1923 was one of the most expensive shows ever made</a>!)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2023: Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-1502573820.jpg><p>This year, Ford starred in the fifth installment of the franchise with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.&nbsp;Ford has said this will be his last Indiana Jones movie, but the character never gets old. It’s hard to believe the suave star is now in his 80s, but he has a truly admirable philosophy. As he told People, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I don’t want to be young again</a>. I was young, and now I enjoy being old.”</p><p>From a young carpenter and bit player on TV to the megastar of cinema’s most beloved franchises, Harrison Ford’s long career has been nothing short of amazing.</p><p><strong>For more famous faces in their youth, read below!</strong></p><p><a href=#>Goldie Hawn Young: Incredible Retro Photos That You Have to See To Believe</a></p><p><a href=#>Young Cher: See the Singer’s Fashion Transformation and Her Wildest Looks</a></p><p><a href=#>20 Throwback Photos of Tom Selleck Young That Prove He’s Always Been a Hunk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJomp6klZe%2FqsDInqposZ%2Bqu6h5x5qpq6GjpLtuss6rmw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fyoung-harrison-ford.html&text=Young%20Harrison%20Ford%3a%20Amazing%20Throw-Back%20Photos&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fyoung-harrison-ford.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fyoung-harrison-ford.html&title=Young%20Harrison%20Ford%3a%20Amazing%20Throw-Back%20Photos" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fyoung-harrison-ford.html&title=Young%20Harrison%20Ford%3a%20Amazing%20Throw-Back%20Photos" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fyoung-harrison-ford.html&title=Young%20Harrison%20Ford%3a%20Amazing%20Throw-Back%20Photos" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fyoung-harrison-ford.html&description=Young%20Harrison%20Ford%3a%20Amazing%20Throw-Back%20Photos" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./best-bridal-mary-jane-flats.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="9 Best Bridal Mary Jane Flats, Inspired by Margaret Qualley">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./psychological-essentialism.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Psychological Essentialism">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
