class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of September 2023, Big Shaq’s net worth is $1 Million.</p><p>Michael Dapaah, known better by one of his stage names “Big Shaq”, is an English comedian, <a href=#>actor</a>, rapper, and social media <a href=#>celebrity</a>.</p><p>He rose to fame with the single “Man’s Not Hot”, which has become a viral sensation worldwide.</p><p>You know he is, you’ve heard the lyrics, and you’ve seen fire in the booth.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span><strong>Early Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Dapaah was born on the 10th of August 1991, in London, England.</p><p>Before his mainstream success as a comedian, Dapaah was working in Vodafone; he said that he’d had enough of that life, and wanted to focus on something that allowed him to unleash more creativity.</p><p>This is when he began creating comedy skits and creating characters like Big Shaq, who’s now become a huge sensation online.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span><strong>Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3>Early <a href=#>Acting</a> Career</h3><p>Michael Dapaah’s upbringing in Croydon, as part of a diverse, Ghanaian immigrant family, played a significant role in his choice of career.</p><p>His multicultural upbringing in South London and his parent’s desire for him to become a doctor were pulling him in opposite directions.</p><p>Dapaah’s interests leaned more toward the arts, specifically <a href=#>acting</a> and comedy, a path he hoped would lead to financial success and fame.</p><p>After spending time in South Africa as a child and following a period of incarceration, Michael’s perspective on life changed.</p><p>In pursuit of his dream, he attended Brunel University, studying for his arts degree and honing his skills in film, <a href=#>acting</a>, and theatre.</p><p>Brunel University produced its fair share of famous, successful <a href=#>celebrity</a> graduates, including actors, singers, and other luminaries such as Greg Davies.</p><p>Dapaah’s commitment to <a href=#>acting</a> led him to enroll in courses at the National Youth Theatre to further develop his <a href=#>acting</a> abilities.</p><h3>Success at the National Youth Theatre</h3><p>After his early success at the National Youth Theatre, Michael gained a following in the British-African community for his comedic roles, establishing a strong fanbase.</p><p>He made brief comedic appearances in the television show, “Meet the Adebanjos,” which centered around a Nigerian family in London, showcasing his comedic talent.</p><p>The show hit a chord as its focus on instilling old-fashioned African values by a flamboyant and outspoken father harked back to his own family.</p><p>His performance was well-received and later led to the launch of “SWIL” (Somewhere in London) together with fellow Brunel graduate, Marv Brown.</p><p>The collaboration between these eager young actors launched the mockumentary series “SWIL” on <a href=#>YouTube</a>, signaling a significant step in his career.</p><h3>Becoming a <a href=#>YouTube</a> Sensation</h3><p>Seeing an opportunity on <a href=#>YouTube</a> and realizing that he could take more direct control of his future, Michael threw himself into the new medium.</p><p>But his big break came with his appearance on “Fire in the Booth” with Charlie Sloth, BBC’s Radio 1Xtra show that catapulted him to fame.</p><p>In the show, Dapaah produced a comedy skit in which he parodied UK gangster stereotypes and rubbished rappers, becoming an “overnight” success.</p><h3>Comedian</h3><p>He went viral on <a href=#>YouTube</a> with his “Fire in the Booth” freestyle clip, performing as “Roadman Shaq,” a character all too recognizable at the time.</p><p>This was followed by another viral success, a comedic rap called “Man’s Not Hot,” which resonated with his global audience and sparked a meme craze.</p><p>Other famous rap celebrities like Stormzy have used their time on the BBC 1XTRA show to help boost their <a href=#>YouTube</a> views and revenue as well.</p><h3><a href=#>Musician</a></h3><p>The official release of his single saw Dapaah’s position in the music industry strengthen, attracting yet more attention both online and for live events.</p><p>With Michael’s career taking off and seeing the success of his latest rap song, he produced a studio track version of “Man’s Not Hot”.</p><p>The “Man’s Not Hot” music video featured cameos by artists Waka Flocka Flame, DJ Khaled<u>,</u> and Dutch rap group Broederliefde, further elevating Dapaah’s profile.</p><h3>Health and Fitness <a href=#>Influencer</a></h3><p>In an unexpected move, Dapaah ventured into the fitness industry in 2020, creating “Belly Must Go,” showcasing his versatility in content creation.</p><p>Rather than focussing on his comedic talent, Michael created a serious health program with a range of topics covering both fitness and nutrition.</p><p>A notable episode&nbsp;included an interview with Francis Ngannou, with the MMA fighter and UFC heavyweight champion showing Michael what it’s like in the ring.</p><p>Michael Dapaah’s career took a creative turn, marked by his diverse array of talents, including <a href=#>acting</a>, comedy, music, and health and fitness.</p><h3>International Recognition</h3><p>This resulted in further international recognition, with followers worldwide appreciating his creative abilities as a comic, songwriter, and <a href=#>lifestyle</a> <a href=#>influencer</a>.</p><p>Such is his influence, that his character, Big Shaq, and the catchphrase “Man’s Not Hot” became iconic in popular culture, helping to boost his popularity.</p><p>With an active social media presence and close connection with fans, his creative projects are sure to see his income steadily increasing in the future.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=michael-dapaah%e2%80%99s-net-worth></span>Michael
