We swam a lot today and we grabbed a bite to eat. All the kids had a blast," Catelynn began before sharing how her mom crossed the line. "Unfortunately, my mom broke one of my boundaries when she was hanging out with all of us and she had a few drinks."</p><p>She continued, "It just really disappoints me. I don't really know why she would do that. It hurts my feelings.

"But like I said, 'You're gonna believe what you want to.'"</p><p>Equally annoyed, Tyler surmised that based on April's behavior, she may have been drinking more than they realized, adding, "She probably had more drinks at the hotel."</p><p>The visit, their first with Carly in two years, comes 14 years after the pair <a href=#><strong>placed Carly for adoption</strong></a> when they were just teens themselves. And April's drinking nearly put it in jeopardy.</p><p>"She's like, 'You should have pulled me aside.' My thing is, I shouldn't have to pull you aside," Catelynn maintained. "Especially in this environment. I'm not focused on that in the moment."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4367b7a7-56cd-41f3-a254-a6fb1d8c6516 data-container-ref=toofab:article:235288d0-b6a0-43ad-9ada-9fc8a17b92d2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6a/5by4/2023/08/25/6aca1109948f40c0a8fc88bc9f216385_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">How Teen Mom Stars Deal with Their Kids Not Wanting to Film Now That They're Older (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Tyler added, "You should just behave. You're so focused on yourself, that you're not even thinking about your daughter's feelings."</p><p>While Catelynn was truly exhausted by her mom's behavior, Tyler offered a gentle reminder that the pair are breaking the cycle of addiction and abuse for their daughters by raising them differently.</p><p>"The way that we raise our children and live our lives, we organically break that lineage and that cycle," Tyler said of their three girls, Nova, 8, Vaeda, 4 and Rya, 21 months. "You have your own path to follow with your mom, but I don't know... just protect your peace at all costs, whatever that cost is."</p><p>Reflecting on the incident in a confessional, Catelynn voiced her frustrations over her mom coming close to spoiling the rare and precious time they get to spend with Carly.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ed/4by3/2023/10/04/edc596ae66084912b96220996ae8641e_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p>"This is my time. All of you people are here, are lucky that you're even here," Catelynn said of the family members and friends she brought along for the visit. "I'm not taking away from my time to deal with your immature, toxic sh-t. I'll deal with that in a day or two when the visit's over. Go back to what is more important here, another day with Carly."</p><p>The second day of Catelynn's visit with Tyler was equally emotional, with the pair making the decision to say goodbye to Carly with a more intimate audience, pairing down those in attendance to them, Catelynn's dad, Dave, and their eldest daughter, Nova.</p><p>"We have to say goodbye. Which is super hard, and really emotional," Catelynn told the camera before cutting to the aftermath of their goodbye with Carly.</p><p>"Well, at least we'll see her next year," the eight-year-old offered in an attempt to comfort her mom.</p><p>"Mom, I just want to say that Carly will always be in your heart," Nova added.</p><p>Despite the sweet words from the little one, both Catelynn and Tyler were overcome with emotion as they grappled with having to wait another year see their daughter.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:dd1a228d-63e5-4044-a4e8-ce295f447e4d data-container-ref=toofab:article:235288d0-b6a0-43ad-9ada-9fc8a17b92d2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=32><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e1/5by4/2023/06/26/e1e38f99f6804fb28f10f9f093a34726_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Catelynn and Tyler Baltierra Reunite with Daughter Carly, 14: 'She's Funny, Kind, SMART, Goofy and STUNNING'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"It's just hard because I wish we could see her more," Catelynn said. "You never want to leave, and that's the crappy part."</p><p>Looking back on the weekend, Catelynn and her family marveled at the one-on-one time they were able to get with Carly and just how much more special the visits have gotten now that she's older.</p><p>"It's awesome seeing all of my girls together," Catelynn marveled.</p><p>The episode ended with Catelynn sharing a special message for her daughter with the cameras.</p><p>"Carly, I just want you to know that you are the biggest blessing in my life. Somebody who has pushed me to grow in so many great ways. You were meant to come into the world to &nbsp;literally create change. To teach me things. To teach your parents things. To teach my other family members things.

I love being able to witness your goofy and silly sides, because it reminds me so much of Ty. And to see that you have a little bit of our personalities is something that's truly amazing."</p><p>"I just want you to know that you are loved. If you weren't loved, I never would have made the decision I made for you," Catelynn added through tears. "Because I wanted to be selfish and not make it sometimes. And I know it would've been selfish to keep you in that chaos. And literally, it's all about love. I don't ever want you to think that you weren't loved or that we didn't want you."</p><p>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter airs Wednesdays on MTV.</p><a id=gallery-link-8e03dd01-7152-5309-863d-9d193ae7e8c5 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:8e03dd01-7152-5309-863d-9d193ae7e8c5 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:235288d0-b6a0-43ad-9ada-9fc8a17b92d2 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2f/4by3/2016/08/25/2f0b5e979e6d58d59ed9a5579cbedc23_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Twitter</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmaWxfmK61scuypadlnaS6bq3Pq6ClZZ6arrO42GaprqGeqHq3tdKiq2ackaq0qcDEq2ScmaKhxm6txa2cq2WUp7avt8innmg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcatelynn-mom-april-nearly-ruins-visit-daughter-carly-after-drinking.html&text=Catelynn%27s%20Mom%20April%20Nearly%20Ruins%20Visit%20With%20Daughter%20Carly%20After%20Drinking&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcatelynn-mom-april-nearly-ruins-visit-daughter-carly-after-drinking.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcatelynn-mom-april-nearly-ruins-visit-daughter-carly-after-drinking.html&title=Catelynn%27s%20Mom%20April%20Nearly%20Ruins%20Visit%20With%20Daughter%20Carly%20After%20Drinking" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcatelynn-mom-april-nearly-ruins-visit-daughter-carly-after-drinking.html&title=Catelynn%27s%20Mom%20April%20Nearly%20Ruins%20Visit%20With%20Daughter%20Carly%20After%20Drinking" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcatelynn-mom-april-nearly-ruins-visit-daughter-carly-after-drinking.html&title=Catelynn%27s%20Mom%20April%20Nearly%20Ruins%20Visit%20With%20Daughter%20Carly%20After%20Drinking" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcatelynn-mom-april-nearly-ruins-visit-daughter-carly-after-drinking.html&description=Catelynn%27s%20Mom%20April%20Nearly%20Ruins%20Visit%20With%20Daughter%20Carly%20After%20Drinking" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./chris-pratt-needed-saving-when-he-met-katherine-schwarzenegger.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Pratt says he was 'broken and really struggling' when he met Katherine Schwarzenegger">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./liverpool-transfer-news-jordon-ibe-17353367.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Arsenal and Chelsea plot stunning moves for Jordon Ibe and Raheem Sterling">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
