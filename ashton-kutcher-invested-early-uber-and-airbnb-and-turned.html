His father worked at a meatpacking plant and his mother was a schoolteacher. Kutcher was studying biochemical engineering at the University of Iowa when he was scouted as a model, which ultimately let to his break in the acting world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Today Kutcher has invested more than US$3 billion into start-ups and taken part in 177 funding rounds over the past decade. This makes Kutcher the most active Hollywood angel in Silicon Valley, according to Business Insider.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Focusing on this simple goal of identifying and enabling amazing entrepreneurs to create a better tomorrow is the crux of my investment strategy,” Kutcher wrote in a blog post for Atrium, a legal and tech start-up.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">What was Trevor Noah’s life like before the models, mansions and millions?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">How and why he got started investing</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kutcher said he began investing because he wanted to connect new companies building solutions to everyday problems with the people who needed them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I spend a lot of time thinking about new and simpler ways to do things, but don’t have enough time to execute on all those ideas,” he told Grow. “So I found people who were executing on them and invested in their success.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kutcher told The Telegraph in 2013 that he was particularly drawn to consumer technologies. “The companies that will ultimately do well are the companies that chase happiness,” he said. “If you find a way to help people find love, or health, or friendship, the dollar will chase that.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That said, his foray into angel investing kicked off when he founded production company Katalyst in 2000, which led to Silicon Valley connections.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Why millennial millionaires are flocking to California</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kutcher poached Katalyst’s digital chief from TechCrunch, who introduced him to the big names in Silicon Valley. “I spent 90 per cent of my time just listening,” Kutcher told Forbes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kutcher soon became familiar with the tech scene. In 2009, at the request of billionaire Marc Andreessen, he invested US$1 million into Skype – 18 months before Microsoft bought the company and quadrupled the value.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">A mentor changed his life and how he’d go on to invest</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Kutcher said his investing career hit a new level after reaching out to Silicon Valley angel investor Ron Conway for guidance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He is one of the godfathers of angel investing,” he said on his news and entertainment website, A Plus. “He completely opened up his investment portfolio to me and really started explaining how things worked and what his strategy was. He has probably been my biggest mentor.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From there, Kutcher went on to co-found venture capital firm A-Grade Investments with talent manager Guy Oseary and businessman Ron Burkle. Within six years, he turned a US$30 million fund into US$250 million.</p>Kutcher and Oseary each poured US$1 million of their own money into the fund, while Burkle contributed US$8 million. A-Grade also received backing from experienced tech executives like Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, as well as <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">businessman Mark Cuban</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A-Grade focused on early-stage investments, according to TechCrunch. Forbes wrote that these start-ups had to have three defining characteristics: founders A-Grade wanted to work with; a problem-solving mission statement that would make the most of time; and a business model A-Grade could grow.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While there were a few failed investments along the way, such as BlackJet and Fab.com, A-Grade made many successful ones: US$500,000 into Uber, US$2.5 million into Airbnb, US$3 million into Spotify, US$300,000 into Warby Parker, and US$1.5 million into Houzz, among many others. These are all multibillion-dollar companies today.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2015, Kutcher and Oseary took a more formal approach to venture investing, co-founding venture fund Sound Ventures with US$100 million from Liberty Media.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Investing other people’s money instead of their own allowed “them to make bigger investments, invest in later-stage start-ups, and put more money into investments that raise follow-on rounds,” according to TechCrunch.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As of 2017, Sound Ventures was managing more than US$100 million in investments, reported The Wall Street Journal. By 2018, it had made over 50 investments and led six rounds of financing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Its portfolio includes Neighborly, a municipal bond crowdfunding start-up, and OpenGov, a financial tech company for local governments.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">These celebrity-owned dogs are living better lives than most people</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kutcher and Oseary told Forbes they’re taking a “typical carry” from Sound Ventures – likely two per cent of cash invested and 20 per cent of profits, plus performance bonuses.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The same year, Kutcher guest-judged on investment show Shark Tank. He was originally hesitant about going on, but felt it “might deliver the opportunity to bring an audience to the show that might not normally watch it,” he told A Plus. “It really is about entrepreneurship and to me the American dream: that you can go off and start something with very little and build something great.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He ended up splitting a US$200,000 investment with Shark Tank judge Lori Greiner for 15 per cent each of Beebo, a shoulder strap that holds a baby bottle for optimal bottle feeding.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Greiner used her expertise to improve packaging and presentation, while Kutcher used his name recognition, massive social media outreach, and role as a new dad to get Beebo the customers it needed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Kutcher has three rules when investing, all focused on what he sees in entrepreneurs</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The first rule is that entrepreneurs must intimately understand both their product and their industry, he told A-plus. They must also have a personality that will allow them to withstand failure and setbacks, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kutcher continued: “You can have the best idea in the world and absolute domain expertise and know how to do everything right, but if you want to do something great in the world, there are going to be obstacles; and you have to be a person who has ingenuity and sheer willpower to get through those times.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The third rule, he added, is that the entrepreneur must get along well with him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the real key to piquing his interest has to do with how well an entrepreneur can spin a compelling narrative, he said at TechCrunch’s live Disrupt SF event in 2018.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“One of the critical tests that I try to run when I’m sitting across from a founder is: ‘Can you sell me your idea?’” Kutcher said at the conference.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Kutcher, the ability to convey a company’s mission determines whether they’ll be able to snag the best talent in a competitive job market. He sees telling the story of an early stage company as integral to its future growth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If you can’t sell me, how are you going to sell your first hire, your second hire, your third hire?” Kutcher added. “How are you going to create the capacity for the rest of your team to sell those next hires?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He’s also doled out a lot of investing advice over the years, often recommending to invest in areas you have knowledge of.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Chelsea Handler’s Netflix talk show, Chelsea, Kutcher offered up his best investment advice: “Invest in the things that you know. If you drink beer all the time – if you go to microbreweries and you try all kinds of them – you probably know which ones are the best, and my advice is always to invest in what you know.” He also emphasised this in his interview with Grow, where one of his top three tips for deciding on what to invest in was to invest in your own expertise.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Bingeing on Netflix and baking cookies? How Elon Musk spends his free time</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And for what you don’t know, he advises finding out everything you can about it. “Know what you don’t know,” he wrote in the Atrium blog.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That involves asking stupid questions. Kutcher advised doing just that at a recent QuickBooks Connect conference. He said that when he was first introduced to key players in the tech world, he would ask every question he could think of.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Learning also requires paying attention. “If you‘re a stock boy in a grocery store and you see something flying off the shelf, find out who made it,” he told Grow. “Find out why it’s flying off the shelf. Do the investigation necessary to know whether it’s something that is going to have ultimate value.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kutcher also told Grow you should invest in what you want to see become reality, but approach your vision carefully. “Worst-case scenario, you lose money – but at least you will get the life you want,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When it comes to implementing that reality, Kutcher has said that while having a vision is important, making a plan is better. At the QuickBooks Connect conference, he advised starting with what you’ve done to work towards your vision or goal, then looking at what you can do next to finally achieve your vision. In other words, nail out the details that get you from point A to B.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Of all his investments, Kutcher said he considers his relationships the best investment he’s made</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Taking the time to get to know [people], what motivates them, what their challenges are,” he told Grow. “These things are often overlooked. Investors get so wrapped up in returns and numbers that they forget that the true privilege of their position is to share a journey with exceptional people.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His philosophy on investing – and life in general – all goes back to his Midwestern roots. He said he wants to give back to those who need a helping hand.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m very appreciative of the things I have,” Kutcher said at QuickBooks. “I’m always fighting for the little guy, no matter what, because I always feel like I am the little guy.
