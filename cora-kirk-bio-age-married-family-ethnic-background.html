Find out about Cora Kirk in this wiki article, from her net worth to her ethnic background and personal life and more.</p><h3><strong>Cora Kirk On Your Christmas Or Mine?</strong></h3><p>Despite being the central characters of the show, Asa and Cora’s characters are apart for the majority of the film. It’s because both of them planned to surprise each other for Christmas, only to find themselves spending Christmas in each other’s home.</p><p>After spending time with each other’s families, James and Hayley realize how much they don’t want to keep things a secret anymore. By the end of the film, they reunite and date happily with the knowledge about each other’s families.</p><p>Your Christmas or Mine? was shot at Pinewood Studios, a legendary movie production studio building only 20 minutes away from central London.</p><p>After the movie’s premiere, The Digital Fix sat down with Cora and Asa, where Cora revealed a lot of things, including what attracted her to the movie and the character, how she managed to build chemistry with the Sex Education actor, and more.</p><p>One of the main reasons that attracted Cora to Your Christmas Or Mine? was because she got the audition on her birthday, a date on which she believes really good things happen to her career. Another reason was her easy-to-read character. Cora said that she found Hayley’s part to be effortless without taking anything away from the scriptwriter of the show, Tom Perry.</p><p>Furthermore, as per Cora, building chemistry with Asa wasn’t that difficult because he was so loveable. Asa revealed that the two also had a chemistry read once before they actually started shooting. The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas actor added that the first big scene at the train station helped them establish a lot of their characterization in the film as a whole.</p><p>When Cora was asked how she felt working closely with acting veterans being relative newcomers in the game and if she took some useful advice from them, she said that she would trouble her senior actors all the time by asking “what’s happening?” I could just watch him [Alex Jennings] and David Bradley, to be honest,&nbsp; observing just how more relaxed they were with the work.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Cora Kirk Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Cora is very new to the entertainment industry. Her first major work came in 2021 in the TV show called Doctors, in which she played the role of Holly Plummer and Morgan Scott.
