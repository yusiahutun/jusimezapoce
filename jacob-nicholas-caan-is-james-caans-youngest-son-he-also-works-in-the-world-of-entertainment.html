James was a renowned actor who appeared in many award-winning films, including “Elf,” “Thief,” “Eraser,” and “The Godfather.”</p><p>James was born in The Bronx, New York, on March 26, 1940. He got into acting in his twenties and starred in numerous hit movies that won him awards. James left a legacy worthy of respect, and nobody knows it better than his direct descendants who inherited it.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jm.jpg><p>One of them is Jacob Nicholas Caan. He has four other siblings, as the late James was married four times and blessed with five kids.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Jacob_Nicholas_Caan_Do_for_a_Living></span>What Does Jacob Nicholas Caan Do for a Living?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jacob was born in Los Angeles, California. He attended a Roman Catholic Preparatory High School for Boys named La Salle High School based in Cincinnati, Ohio. Later, he enrolled at Chapman University, where he graduated in 2021.</p><p>Given who his father is, Jacob most likely would have been able to achieve great success as an actor in Hollywood. However, acting was not at the top of his list of priorities. He had other interests in mind.&nbsp;</p><p>According to several reports, as of 2023, Jacob <a href=#>works</a> as a costume designer and is very good at what he does. Some believe he may have inherited his passion for aesthetics from his mother, a costume designer at some point in her life.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jacob_Nicholas_Caan_Was_Close_to_His_Late_Dad></span>Jacob Nicholas Caan Was Close to His Late Dad&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>James Caan may not have had much luck with romance. However, he was great to have as a father. Just ask <a href=#>Jacob Nicholas Caan</a>, his fifth child, who enjoyed joining him for public events as a child.&nbsp;</p><p>That reduced the older Jacob got, but his love for his father did not. Even after he got older, he was still spotted spending time with his father. In February 2020, Jacob and his father were pictured enjoying dinner at Vibrato Grill Jazz.</p><p>They were both casually dressed, and James looked to have been enjoying his time with his boy. He wore a slight smile the whole time, and when they finished, he was wheeled away by Jacob.&nbsp;</p><p>The veteran actor had reportedly been in a wheelchair because of a back surgery he had at the time. While James lived, it was believed that Jacob had the strongest bond with him because of how often they were pictured on outings.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jacob_Nicholas_Caan_Is_James_Caans_Youngest_Son></span>Jacob Nicholas Caan Is James Caan’s, Youngest Son&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The first woman James Caan married was Dee Jay Mathis, who was not Jacob’s mother. James and Mathis tied the knot in 1961 and welcomed a daughter, Tara Caan, on November 5, 1964.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, two years after her birth, the couple split in 1966. Some years passed before James took another woman to the altar. However, she was also not Jacob’s mother.&nbsp;</p><p>James’s second wife was Elvis Presley’s former girlfriend and Playboy cover model, Sheila Marie Ryan. The pair tied the knot in 1976, but they mutually decided to call it quits after a year.&nbsp;</p><p>When they were married, they welcomed James’ second child and first son, Scott Andrew Caan. James got married again in 1990 to Ingrid Hajek, and together they welcomed his second son, Alexander James Caan, on April 10, 1991.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/famm-1.jpg><p>Their marriage lasted until 1994, when they chose to end what they had. James’ last marriage was to Linda Stokes in 1995, and it was the longest-lived union the actor ever had.&nbsp;</p><p>It lasted for more than two decades until 2016, when they both chose to divorce. While married, they welcomed two boys, James Arthur Caan, born on November 6, 1995, and Jacob Nicholas Caan, born on September 24, 1998.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jacob_Gets_Along_With_His_Siblings></span>Jacob Gets Along With His Siblings&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There is no abundance of information regarding James Caan’s children. However, there has been no report of dissent among them.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/james-scott-lwren-scott.jpg><p>It is believed that they all get along fine even though their lives are entirely different. Jacob Nicholas Caan gets by as a designer. His step-sister Tara is a profoundly private woman, so little gets out about her.&nbsp;</p><p>His oldest brother Scott became an actor like his father and has been featured in hot movies, including “Gone in 60 Seconds,” “Ocean 11,” and “James Split.” The next oldest, Alexander, is a musician known as Audio Medic.&nbsp;</p><p>The third oldest, James, is as private as Tara, so nothing is known about his life. All five are part of James Caan’s legacy, active in Hollywood or not. The actor is one of the stars who had terrible luck with marriages like <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a>. However, while he lived, he never regretted his choices.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kt6Kvzptkp6GTnbytrdJmmpqZnmK2tHnJmqSeq12YrqK60mawqK2enLK0wIyspqdlmJp6orjSqGSwp6KgwG61zWaroZ1drLyzuMNmpp9llaPBpr7TmqCnpZWjwXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjacob-nicholas-caan-is-james-caans-youngest-son-he-also-works-in-the-world-of-entertainment.html&text=Jacob%20Nicholas%20Caan%20Is%20James%20Caan%27s%20Youngest%20Son%3a%20He%20Also%20Works%20in%20the%20World%20of%20Entertainment&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjacob-nicholas-caan-is-james-caans-youngest-son-he-also-works-in-the-world-of-entertainment.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjacob-nicholas-caan-is-james-caans-youngest-son-he-also-works-in-the-world-of-entertainment.html&title=Jacob%20Nicholas%20Caan%20Is%20James%20Caan%27s%20Youngest%20Son%3a%20He%20Also%20Works%20in%20the%20World%20of%20Entertainment" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjacob-nicholas-caan-is-james-caans-youngest-son-he-also-works-in-the-world-of-entertainment.html&title=Jacob%20Nicholas%20Caan%20Is%20James%20Caan%27s%20Youngest%20Son%3a%20He%20Also%20Works%20in%20the%20World%20of%20Entertainment" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjacob-nicholas-caan-is-james-caans-youngest-son-he-also-works-in-the-world-of-entertainment.html&title=Jacob%20Nicholas%20Caan%20Is%20James%20Caan%27s%20Youngest%20Son%3a%20He%20Also%20Works%20in%20the%20World%20of%20Entertainment" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjacob-nicholas-caan-is-james-caans-youngest-son-he-also-works-in-the-world-of-entertainment.html&description=Jacob%20Nicholas%20Caan%20Is%20James%20Caan%27s%20Youngest%20Son%3a%20He%20Also%20Works%20in%20the%20World%20of%20Entertainment" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./torchd-isaac-calpito-workout-kelly-ripa-lisa-rinna-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Torch'd's Isaac Calpito on Training Kelly Ripa and Keeping Class Flirty">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-to-get-rid-of-a-hickey.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Get Rid of a Hickey Fast, According to Experts">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
