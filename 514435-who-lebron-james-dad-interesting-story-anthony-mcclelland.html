All the details</span></p></a><h2>Who is LeBron James’ dad?</h2><p class=align-left>LeBron James’ father is Anthony McClelland. He was born in the 1960s and hails from Ohio, USA. There is nothing much about Anthony’s background besides the fact that he was<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> in and out of prison</a> in numerous instances.</p><p class=align-left>Interestingly, the <a href=#>basketballer</a> never met his father, and Anthony McClelland remains estranged. Anthony was in a relationship with LeBron James’ mother while she was only 16 years old when she gave birth to LeBron.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, McClelland wasn’t supportive of the <a href=#>family</a> and didn’t take responsibility for his son. Therefore, Gloria, LeBron James’ mother, raised him as a single mother.</p><p class=align-left>There’s some confusion surrounding LeBron James’s dad, as he is known by another name, Roland Biven. There are reports that Biven died in a drive-by shooting incident in 1994. There is speculation that Biven did not die in the drive-by and altered his name to Anthony McClelland to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">escape jail time</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c574055f8c99bd41.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tyler Hynes and Erin Krakow's relationship and love story</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, the allegations have never been confirmed to be accurate or if McClelland and Biven are the same person.</p><p class=align-left>Another story is where McClelland reportedly tried to reconnect with LeBron James in 2002. However, LeBron James declined the request.</p><h2>Does LeBron have a relationship with his dad?</h2><p class=align-left>LeBron James doesn’t have a <a href=# title>relationship </a>with his father. He has always felt resentment towards his dad and, in 2014, sent him a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">message on Instagram</a> expressing gratitude for not having him around.</p>Like, 'Wow, Dad, you know what, I don't know you, I have no idea who you are, but because of you is part of the reason I am today.' The fuel I use—you not being there—is part of why I grew up to become myself. It's part of why I want to be hands-on with my endeavours...

The truth</span></p></a><h2>Does LeBron know who his father is?</h2><p class=align-left>In the expressive Instagram post where LeBron James thanked his father for not being part of his life, he stated that he has no idea who he is. LeBron said, however, that his father's absence is part of his success.</p><h2>What happened to LeBron James's dad?</h2><p class=align-left>LeBron James’ father’s whereabouts are unknown, and most information available is speculative or confusing. However, one thing is sure about LeBron’s dad. He had a criminal record when he was in a short relationship with Gloria and has likely been in prison a few times.</p><h2>Did Anthony McClelland play basketball?</h2><p class=align-left>There is a high chance that Anthony McClelland's height is the same as LeBron’s hence the possibility of <a href=#>playing basketball</a>. It is reported that Anthony McClelland played basketball in the neighbourhood. However, it wasn't at the elevated level of LeBron James, who is among the greatest of all time in the professional <a href=#>sport</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/10f7588517a342f0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Donna Goudeau and what happened to her?

And there needs to be more clarity about LeBron James never meeting him; hence it is not even verified whether he is the basketballer's father.</p><h2>Final word on LeBron James’ dad</h2><p class=align-left>LeBron James’s dad has never been part of the basketballer’s life, and LeBron is not interested in meeting him. However, he thanks him for not being part of his life as it shaped and moulded him into one of the best in America’s basketball history.</p><p class=align-left>Are you searching for more information about Andrew East’s dad, Guy East?
