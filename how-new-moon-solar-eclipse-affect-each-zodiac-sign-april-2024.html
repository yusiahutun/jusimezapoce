Eclipses always tell a story that often unfolds in completely unexpected ways. If you can’t help but wonder <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>how the total solar eclipse of April 2024 will affect each zodiac sign</a>, that’s because it could potentially alter the course of your life. This eclipse is a powerful catalyst for personal growth, bringing changes that affect the entire collective. Profound insight will be unveiled as a new path of life becomes illuminated.</p><p>Eclipses are harbingers <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>of fated events</a>. Throughout history, this notorious phenomenon has always been associated with both fear and awe, occurring when the sun, moon, and Earth align in a way that obscures one of the luminaries. For example: a solar eclipse is equivalent to a super potent new moon (when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun), while a lunar eclipse resembles the energy of a supercharged full moon (when the Earth positions itself between the sun and the moon). And because eclipses often force us to change paths and redirect course, it’s known for bringing major changes into reality that often come as a shock.</p><p>This is one of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>most pivotal astrological events of 2024</a>, as April’s solar eclipse rises in the bold and ferociously determined fire sign known as Aries. This eclipse will also be “total”, which speaks to the severity of its consequences. During a total solar eclipse, the moon completely blocks the sun, casting a shadow on the Earth while briefly plunging parts of our world into darkness, literally and figuratively. The darkness essentially represents our individual and collective journey into the unknown, reminding us to surrender and trust even when the path is not visible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-29.png><p>Taking place on April 8 at 2:21 p.m. ET via 19 degrees of Aries, everything about this celestial event is action-packed, thanks to the fact that it falls in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the Mars-ruled sign of Aries</a>. Think back to Spring 2023, when the North Node entered Aries and the South Node entered Libra. The Aries-Libra axis descibres the dichotomy between the “self” and the “other.” Aries and Libra encompass the full spectrum of interpersonal dynamics, from how we assert our identity to the way we negotiate the terms of our relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>The North Node in Aries is collectively pushing us towards embracing autonomy and personal growth, while <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the South Node</a> highlights past behaviors and relationship patterns that need to be released, such as over-reliance and codependency. A call for assertion, courage, and leadership, this eclipse will support us as we pursue our goals with renewed vigor and determination. Aries is, after all, the first sign of the zodiac, so consider this a powerful opportunity to start a new or perhaps even reinvent outdated aspects of your life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-32.png><p>Sitting in an exact conjunction with Chiron (the wounded healer), this eclipse magnifies the potential for growth and healing. This new beginning could also be incredibly emotional, sensitive, and vulnerable, but there’s nothing to be ashamed of. This eclipse is also taking place <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>during Mercury retrograde</a>, which will be in close proximity to the sun and moon. This adds a dose of confusion to the mix, so remember that which actions speak louder than words. Misunderstandings or delays may occur, reinforcing that your actions will speak volumes. If you’ve been holding back or uncertain about asserting yourself, this provides a potent opportunity to take your power back.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>The total solar eclipse in Aries takes place on April 8 at 2:21 p.m. ET.</p></figure><p>This eclipse also takes place while combative Mars is in conjunction with inhibiting <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Saturn in Pisces</a>, bringing the two most malefic planets in astrology together. This could make you feel overly cautious before you feel compelled to move forward, as the weight of our personal responsibilities and ethics feels heavier than ever. This could feel like a tug-of-war between the desire to act (Mars) vs. the need to wait for the right moment (Saturn). You also have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jupiter in Taurus</a> approaching its conjunction with Uranus, which will be exact on April 20. This is already sparking unexpected breakthroughs and developments in the realm of finance and stability.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-new-moon-solar-eclipse-will-affect-each-zodiac-sign>How the New Moon Solar Eclipse Will Affect Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming solar eclipse in Aries, according to your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sun sign</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>moon sign</a>, or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.8590852904821><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zodiacbannerday_aries.png><p>If you’re feeling called to redefine yourself and your goals, it’s not a coincidence.
