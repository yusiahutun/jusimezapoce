The purpose of the game is to see who can pull down the most Christmas tree ornaments. To play, have each individual be blindfolded and then give them a stack of Christmas tree ornaments. Then, in one minute, they should endeavor to take down as many decorations as possible. The winner is the player whose decorations are the most trashed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZH92ecGeqq1ln5uzqq%2FEZqeaqqSueqS00aKqraWRqHqorcyeqg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f25-best-office-party-christmas-games.html&text=25%20Best%20Office%20Party%20Christmas%20Games&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f25-best-office-party-christmas-games.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f25-best-office-party-christmas-games.html&title=25%20Best%20Office%20Party%20Christmas%20Games" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f25-best-office-party-christmas-games.html&title=25%20Best%20Office%20Party%20Christmas%20Games" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f25-best-office-party-christmas-games.html&title=25%20Best%20Office%20Party%20Christmas%20Games" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f25-best-office-party-christmas-games.html&description=25%20Best%20Office%20Party%20Christmas%20Games" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./watch-courteney-cox-recreates-friends-turkey-head-dance-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Courteney Cox Gives Gift Of Recreating Her Iconic Friends Turkey Dance on Instagram">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./fun-funerals-funny-songs-make-17109191.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Putting the fun in FUNERAL: Were now picking hit songs for mourners at services">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
