JENN,</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last time I gave my boyfriend oral sex, he asked me to put a finger into his butt. This totally freaked me out. Why does he want me to do that? Even if I were going to try, I'm not even sure how. Help? — Butt Why</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>DEAR BUTT WHY,</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Let me be the first to tell you that anal stimulation for heterosexual men is the hottest new trend since herringbone. Your boyfriend is no dummy. Stimulating, massaging, or milking the prostate can result in orgasms <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>that are 33 percent stronger</a> than average. And as men of many sexual orientations know: The best way to get to that prostate is up the butt. That's just where it is.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What is the prostate?<br>The prostate is a small, walnut-sized gland located just beneath a man's bladder. It surrounds the urethra like a doughnut. When a man becomes aroused, it swells up with the fluid that makes up semen, sending pleasurable sensations throughout his loins as he nears orgasm. The "P-Spot," as some call it, can be located and stimulated by putting a well-lubricated finger two to three inches into a man's anus. This can result in what some men described as full body orgasms. Women can enjoy this, too, by the way. While women don't have a prostate, there is a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>high concentration of nerve endings</a> in the area.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Protection Is Key</strong><br>Most people know that anal intercourse is a high-risk activity when it comes to HIV. Manual play is a little more of a gray area. The mucus in the lining of the rectum of an HIV positive person <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>contains the virus</a> which can be transmitted. In addition, because the area is so fragile, it can tear easily which means that there could be blood which is a high risk fluid to play with. In order to play safely, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">latex gloves</a> or a <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">finger cot</a> is recommded.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How to start anal stimulation? Slowly.</strong><br>Let me share a few tips to make that finger situation more pleasant for both of you. Any kind of anal play is always best done after a shower. Some super considerate lovers even opt to give themselves an enema beforehand, but that is not necessary. If you are concerned about things getting messy, put a towel down where are you are planning to play. And speaking of being considerate: Make sure your fingernails are trimmed or filed. This is not a self-lubricating area, so you will need to use lubricant. I recommend a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>silicone based lube for this</a>, since it lasts longer and cuts down on reapplication.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once you are gloved and lubed up, you want to ease into the situation. A little touching before penetration is nice no matter who's giving or receiving (and where), and anal play is no different. It's a hyper-sensitive area and can bring men off-the-charts pleasure, but a slow start makes all the difference.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The nerves around the anus are the same branches that reach his penis and testicles. Having physically relaxed muscles is important for this to be a pleasurable experience. Learning to receive stimulation to a new part of the body can take some getting used to. This tends to be most successful when he is already turned on, at which point you may want to start by gently touching at and around the opening. When you do eventually put your lubricated finger in, go slowly! Make sure to be sensitive to any feedback that he is giving you. Getting familiar with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>an anatomy chart </a>can help you to find the prostate even more easily. (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>The Pleasure Mechanics</a> have a great instructional video.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: 5 Real Women Reveal the Sex Positions That Always Make Them Orgasm</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Know the Moves</strong><br>Once you have eased your finger into the area, moving it back-and-forth, like in a come hither motion, is a great way to stimulate the prostate. When a man gets stimulated it becomes easier to find because it swells up. Stimulating him with a generous reach-around, or while performing oral as your boyfriend requested, can put him over the edge. Once you get past the basics, you may <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>want to try anal toys</a>. Keep in mind, as an ER doctor friend of mine once said, "The butt is like a vacuum. Things that you put up there get sucked up." Therefore it is important when using toys for anal play that they are specifically designed for this area so they don't get "sucked up."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And this brings me to a common misconception about who, exactly, would enjoy this kind of thing. Recently I was on a radio show talking about this erogenous zone, and the male host was stunned that heterosexual men enjoy this activity. This thinking is very retrograde. As soon as he said that the call lines were flooded with straight guys raving about the orgasms that go along with this kind of play. Our bodies are meant to be explored and enjoyed through all kinds of stimulation. Whatever you and your partner are game to try and feel good about should be on the table. When it comes to sexual exploration, don't limit yourself to old ideas of what is acceptable and what is not. I encourage you to experiment, if your partner is interested; you just may give him the most intense orgasms of his life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8CnmKVlo6m2rsHLmquip55itbDDjK2mZqClor1usMCy</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fanal-stimulation-how-to-hump-day.html&text=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20Anal%20Stimulation&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fanal-stimulation-how-to-hump-day.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fanal-stimulation-how-to-hump-day.html&title=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20Anal%20Stimulation" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fanal-stimulation-how-to-hump-day.html&title=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20Anal%20Stimulation" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fanal-stimulation-how-to-hump-day.html&title=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20Anal%20Stimulation" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fanal-stimulation-how-to-hump-day.html&description=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20Anal%20Stimulation" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tommy-winkler.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tommy Winkler - Bio, Career, Age, Net Worth, Nationality, Facts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ariana-grande-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="25 Facts About Ariana Grande: The Best Live Vocals">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
