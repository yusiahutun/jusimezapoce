From doing some exotic dance to fantastic trick, she is also known for her gravity-defying tricks. Well, Miami is more than just a stripper, she is also a rapper and a hip-hop performer. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-172 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Career and Net Worth</h2><p>Since dancing was her passion, she started her career as a performing artist at the age of seventeen on a professional level. Later on, she became one of the best in stripping business. She used to do amazing tricks from the club’s 30-foot ceilings and fearlessly sliding all the way down. As time passed, she started getting offers from several different cities. Likewise, she expanded her reputation even further.</p><p>But one day her act went wrong. She fell from 35-foot long strip pool as per wiki while executing her act in the club, ‘King of Diamonds’ in February 2012&nbsp;that left her with multiple injuries. After the incident, Maimi took a break from stripping.</p><p>After 18 months of the accident and into recovery, Maimai the stripper is now Tip Drill rapper. It was the turning point in her life. The soaring height of Miami's career took place when she released her debut album, ‘The Transition’ in 2016. Miami was one of the cast members of MTV favorite show, ‘Love & Hip Hop Miami’ in its first season. She started appearing in many videos with famous artist including Nicki Minaj, French Montana, and Plies. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Miami does not seem interested in sharing the details of her net worth. However, given her rise in the music industry and celeb appearances, there surely must be lots of commas in her bank account.</p><h2>Miami's Romance With Keyara Stone</h2><p>While Miami was the familiar face of the MTV's show, audiences might also know her fellow contestant Keyara Stone. They had shared quite a past, abusing and physically tormenting each other. The&nbsp;feud&nbsp;of Miami with Keyara, whose former boyfriend is Gunplay, was seen in the different episodes of the reality show. The trios and their past dating history have given the audience with all the reality that relates their personal life. Not only that, Keyara was also seen flirting with Miami at the bonus clip of ‘Love & Hip Hop Miami.’</p><p>But fans will be more surprised to know an incident at a nightclub where the former foe shared a cozy moment with each other.&nbsp;It has never been adequately clear to the viewers on their relationship which might&nbsp;be updated&nbsp;in the coming episodes of the reality series later on.&nbsp;</p><p>She is also known to be the ex-girlfriend of one of the former participants, Richard Morales popularly known as ‘Gunplay.’ Regardless nothing further can be developed on the relationship of Miami with her boyfriend which made the couple to separate ways for unknown reasons.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187></span><p><span style=color:#000>Miami tip, sharing a cozy moment with Keyara Stone at one of the nightclubs&nbsp;in 2018 (Photos: </span><span style=color:#000>Vh1)</span></p><h2>Is Miami Married?</h2><p>Miami has a son named Sincere, and the baby was born while she was still a teenager. But due to the lack of details in knowing the baby daddy, people are still unaware of his father. The dancer has never shown any interest in clearing if she was married with her baby daddy or was it just an affair. But she has never been shy about revealing her real identity to be&nbsp;a&nbsp;bisexual. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Short Bio</h2><p>Miami was born on December 30, 1985, in Long Island, New York. She is currently 32 years of age and was raised by a single mother in Florida. Her mother who also played role as her father in Miami life has kept her identity, occupational background a secret. Standing a lofty&nbsp;height, Miami belongs to Puerto Rican black in ethnicity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2r7HTsKarrJhjsLC5jpycpZ2Sp7a1tcSsZqahkaK2bsDIqWSwoZueeqKzxGaZoqqknbGixYyhnKKfmKl6sa3RnqWtq12XvLqy0aKcp5xdma61tc2gZJqelpa2s7%2BNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmiami-tip-wiki-age-birthday-height-parents-boyfriend-dating-affairs-html.html&text=Miami%20Tip%20Wiki%3a%20Age%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Height%2c%20Parents%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Dating%2c%20Affairs&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmiami-tip-wiki-age-birthday-height-parents-boyfriend-dating-affairs-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmiami-tip-wiki-age-birthday-height-parents-boyfriend-dating-affairs-html.html&title=Miami%20Tip%20Wiki%3a%20Age%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Height%2c%20Parents%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Dating%2c%20Affairs" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmiami-tip-wiki-age-birthday-height-parents-boyfriend-dating-affairs-html.html&title=Miami%20Tip%20Wiki%3a%20Age%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Height%2c%20Parents%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Dating%2c%20Affairs" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmiami-tip-wiki-age-birthday-height-parents-boyfriend-dating-affairs-html.html&title=Miami%20Tip%20Wiki%3a%20Age%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Height%2c%20Parents%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Dating%2c%20Affairs" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmiami-tip-wiki-age-birthday-height-parents-boyfriend-dating-affairs-html.html&description=Miami%20Tip%20Wiki%3a%20Age%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Height%2c%20Parents%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Dating%2c%20Affairs" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ravens-coach-john-harbaugh-excited-for-brother-jims-new-job-with-chargers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ravens Coach John Harbaugh Excited For Brother Jims New Job With Chargers">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./cate-blanchett-hot-ones-sean-evans-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cate Blanchett Kind of Wants to Play Hot Ones Host Sean Evans">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
