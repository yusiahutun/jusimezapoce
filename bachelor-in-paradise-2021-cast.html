(We revealed who else is in the cast in the spoilers at the bottom of the article.) As Bachelor Nation members also know, host <a href=# rel=noopener>Chris Harrison</a> quit the Bachelor franchise in 2020 after his controversial comments about The Bachelor season 25 winner <a href=# rel=noopener>Rachael Kirkconnell</a>‘s racism scandal. Instead, Bachelor in Paradise season 7 will be hosted by a rotating list of celebrities such as David Spade, Lance Bass, Tituss Burgess and Lil Jon.</p><p>“There’s love, there’s romance. There’s a lot of drama, you know, it’s got everything,” Wells Adams, who returns as the bartender of BIP, told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> in July. “The drinks are bad, the advice is worse, but the bar is open. … There are some twists and turns that I was shocked by, and I never thought would ever happen on the show. And I think people are really, really going to love this season.”</p><p>During an episode of his podcast, “Bachelor Happy Hour,” in July, Wells also teased that something that he’s never seen in his five seasons he’s been on Bachelor in Paradise happens in season 7. “Of all the five seasons I’ve done in Paradise, the craziest stuff happens on this season. I think no one is going to expect what happens,” he said. “What happens this season is insane.” Guest host Tituss Burgess also teased that Bachelor in Paradise season 7 isn’t short of the drama. “Honestly for me, all I had to do was keep my ear to the ground and listen for what was happening, the drama, the love triangles, all of it. It kind of does the job for you,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight.</a> “You zoom out and then you figure out, well, we need a party here. We need a date night here. We need to mix this up and see just how serious this person is about the other person.”</p><p>And for those who have watched past Bachelor in Paradise seasons, Joe Amabile, who was on Bachelor in Paradise season 5 and returned for season 7, told the “Click Bait” podcast July that the current season is more “insane” and “intense” than his first. “I wasn’t expecting to be original cast,” he said. “I forgot all of what Paradise is about and it is a wild ride, and this season is insane. It really is. … It almost was, like, every day got more and more intense.” He continued, “It was a lot different than my first time. It was wild.”</p><p>As for those who wonder how much Bachelor in Paradise is real, guest host Lance Bass told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> in August that the drama is very, very real. “I was surprised to see how real everything was, because, you know, those shows can probably get very heavily produced,” he said. “[I thought,] ‘They’ve been on the franchise before, it’s like they come in kind of like actors.’ Like, ‘OK, I know what y’all need. Let’s do this.’”</p><p>So who’s in the<a href=# rel=noopener> Bachelor in Paradise</a> 2021 cast? Read on ahead for which Bachelor Nation alums made their way to the beach this summer.
