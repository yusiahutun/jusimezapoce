Her journey from a young prodigy to a dominant force in women’s golf is remarkable.</p><p>The female golf world seems to be dominated by women who are not only beautiful but also quite young. One such woman is Lexi Thompson, and when you look at her age, you begin to wonder how she was able to achieve success so quickly in her career. Did she start playing golf in the womb or what makes her so good? We will go into all this and more here while you learn about one of America’s best golfers, Lexi Thompson.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Key Takeaways:</h3><ul><li>Lexi Thompson, born in 1995, is an accomplished American golfer with numerous professional victories.</li><li>Raised in a family of golfers, she started playing at a young age and quickly rose through the ranks.</li><li>Lexi’s successful career includes becoming the youngest winner on the LPGA Tour at age 16.</li><li>Despite speculation about her personal life, including rumors about her sexual orientation, she remains focused on her golfing achievements.</li><li>With ongoing success and room for improvement, she is positioned to potentially reach the number-one ranking in women’s golf.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Bio of&nbsp;</strong><strong>Lexi Thompson</strong></h2><p>Lexi Thompson was born on February 10, 1995, in Coral Springs, Florida in the United States of America. Her birth name is Alexis Thompson, while her mother’s name is Amanda Thompson and her father’s name is Scott Thompson. She is an American nationality by birth and belongs to the white ethnic group.</p><p>It can be said that Lexi inherited her golfing talent from her father because he used to be a golfer who started playing at a very young age and later became a golf coach when he stopped competing. Her two brothers discussed below are also professional golfers.</p><p>For her education, Lexis was home-schooled during her high school years, and by September 2012 she had secured admission to Louisiana State University to earn a college degree. She must have graduated by now, but it is not yet known what degree she received from the educational institution.</p><p>Since Lexis was born into a family of golfers, she could not have considered it strange to play the sport, which is mainly dominated by men. She started playing at a very young age and qualified for the US Women’s Open in 2007 as the youngest player at the age of 12. She did not win the competition, but in the same year, she won the Aldila Junior Classic, becoming the second-youngest player in the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA) to win the title in addition to winning the Westfield Junior PGA Championship, as the youngest person ever at the time.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who is Jamie Hyneman’s Wife, Eileen Walsh? Kids, Net Worth, Is He Dead?</a></strong></p><p>Her amateur golf laurels boast a total of 3 championship victories, including the 2003 and 2004 U.S. Kids Golf World Championship, 2008 U.S. Girls’ Junior, while her other successes as an amateur golfer include second round, U.S. Girls’ Junior in 2007, a quarter-finalist in U.S. Women’s Amateur of the same year, third round in 2009, U.S. Girls’ Junior and semi-finalist, U.S. Women’s Amateur of the same year.</p><p>Lexi Thompson began playing professional golf in 2010 and signed sponsorship agreements with Red Bull and Cobra-PUMA Golf. Her first three professional golf tournaments earned her $314,842. Her first professional win came on February 21, 2011, at a Fuzion Tour round-robin event at her home course in Coral Springs, Florida. In September she won her first LPGA tournament, the Navistar LPGA Classic at the age of 16, making her the youngest winner on the LPGA Tour at the time.</p><p>Lexi’s successes in her professional career boast 9 victories on the LPGA Tour, including Navistar LPGA Classic, Sime Darby LPGA Malaysia, Lorena Ochoa Invitational, Kraft Nabisco Championship, Meijer LPGA Classic, LPGA KEB Hana Bank Championship, Honda LPGA Thailand, Kingsmill Championship, and Indy Women in Tech Championship. Lexi has also won a LET victory (Dubai Ladies Masters) and an LPGA of Japan Tour victory (World Ladies Championship Salonpas Cup).</p><p>Over the years, she has continued to improve her position in the women’s golf world rankings at the end of each year. In 2009, Lexi was ranked 246th in the world rankings, but in 2017 she moved up to 4th in the rankings. As she is still young, very young, and still has plenty of room to improve her accuracy, it should come as no surprise when we see that in the not-too-distant future, she will be number one in the rankings.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Brother</strong></h2><p>Thompson’s family includes Nicholas and Cutis Thompson; her brothers, who also played golf from a young age. You should know why – her father.</p><p>The two brothers are doing well on their own course, although they have not been as successful on the golf course as their sister. Nicholas plays on the PGA and Web.com Tour, while his brother Curtis plays mainly on the Web.com Tour.</p><p>Of note in Nicholas’ career are his wins at the 2005 Jones Cup Invitational and the 2007 HSBC New Zealand PGA Championship, as well as his appearance with the US National Golf Team that won the Walker Cup in 2005.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Stacy Lewis Married, Husband, Age, Height, Net Worth, Bio</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Height&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The golfer has an impressive height of about 6 feet with a body weight of 72 kg.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who is she Dating, Partner (Boyfriend), or Lexi Thompson Gay?</strong></h2><p>If you are young and successful, people’s next question will usually be who is her love interest. If an answer cannot be given easily, the person is often quickly labeled as gay, as it is one of the things that over time is associated with people who take too long to reveal their feelings for them.</p><p>Lexi has certainly achieved much success and fame through her golf career, and apart from her commendable achievements, it is quite surprising to know that she has not revealed the identity of a man who makes her do the things women do when they are in love. She has not been seen in public with anyone, nor has anyone drawn attention to her by claiming, with or without proof, that he is interested in her.</p><p>However, an article published on espnW.com in 2015 reported that she had a boyfriend who “has his own life”, but many years have passed since then and the man’s identity has yet to be revealed. The lack of a male figure in her life has led people to speculate that she is probably gay. Others drew their conclusion from the way they believed they had heard her voice, which they believe is very masculine. So if she sounds like a man and has no boyfriend, she is probably gay.</p><p>Well, until Thompson reveals her sexual orientation, we can consider it a fact for now that she is still single, not dating anyone, has no partner, and cannot be conclusively called gay.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is Lexi Thompson dating anyone or is she gay?</strong></h3><p>Lexi Thompson’s personal life remains private, with no confirmed partner.
