Now, we know that being sexy has more to do with a certain je ne sais quoi. Although science has tried to measure what makes a person more appealing, most of us know that attractiveness can’t be boiled down to algorithms. Real sexiness is in the eye of the beholder.</p><p>But if you’re looking for ways to be more attractive, you’ll be happy to know most of it won’t cost you a dime and doesn’t take long at all. Here are 40 tips to be more sexy almost immediately.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><h2><strong>1. Always Make Eye Contact</strong></h2><p>And not just with your partner—looking everyone you’re interacting with&nbsp;squarely in the eye won’t&nbsp;only will boost your own confidence, but it’ll&nbsp;get people to see you as confident and in control, which usually&nbsp;translates to sexy.</p><h2><strong>2. Focus on Dynamic Attractiveness</strong></h2><p>Sure, physical beauty is a key component in&nbsp;innate <a href=# id=auto-tag_sex data-tag=sex>sex</a> appeal, but&nbsp;dynamic attractiveness involves the expression of our emotions and our underlying personality—and can critically boost your personal charisma. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Psychology Today</a>, expressing positive affect—smiling, employing&nbsp;an upbeat attitude,&nbsp;having&nbsp;expressive eyes, are all associated with <a href=# id=auto-tag_sex-appeal data-tag=sex-appeal>sex appeal</a>.</p><h2><strong>3. You’ve Got A Brain—Use It!</strong></h2><p>A sharp, healthy mind can be akin to healthy body when&nbsp;it comes to being sexy. This means occasionally challenging yourself by having challenging conversation, expressing interest in new things, reading books on new topics, or even just watching a documentary about something you never knew. The more you know, the more you can talk about in an informed way, which is a defining factor in real sex&nbsp;appeal.</p><h2><strong>4. Humor Counts&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Yeah, we know that razor-sharp wit isn’t something that can be learned, and we’re not all able to be truly funny all the&nbsp;time, but not taking yourself or the world around you too&nbsp;seriously is&nbsp;a key component in being sexy. Plus, everyone loves a good sense of humor.</p><h2><strong>5. Get Your Hair Blown Out<br></strong></h2><p>Almost all of us can certainly attest than when our hair looks bad, we often feel bad. Turns out, that’s not all in our heads, either:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Studies have shown</a>&nbsp;women spend around 20 years of their lives suffering from a bad hair day, and that it can greatly affect mood and confidence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gettyimages-509784238.jpg><h2><strong>6. Expose Your Wrists</strong></h2><p>No, not because they’re attractive but because the glands in your wrists emit pheromones which can trigger feelings of attraction in others.</p><h2><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Take Up Yoga<br></strong></h2><p>A study in the&nbsp;Journal of Sexual Medicine&nbsp;found that women who regularly did&nbsp;yoga actually felt sexier. Why? Researchers say it could be because yoga encourages&nbsp;a stronger mind-body connection.</p><h2><strong>8. Test Out Some Sexy Lingerie</strong></h2><p>Along the way,&nbsp;lingerie&nbsp;became synonymous with tawdry—dare we day&nbsp;porn-y—pieces that look as if they belong on people eagerly awaiting the arrival of the hot young pizza delivery guy. And while that’s true in some respects,&nbsp;there’s also quite a lot of very elegantly sexy&nbsp;underpinnings out there that are sexy without&nbsp;being tacky.</p><h2><strong>9. Don’t Assume Showing More Is Sexier</strong></h2><p>You’ve heard it before: Showing tons of skin does not always translate to sexy. Bootie shorts, skin-tight clothes, insanely low-cut tops all can make you look less sexy, or like you’re trying too hard.&nbsp;Love your body and want to show it off? Great! Do it ways that are truly sexy, as opposed to flashy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gettyimages-496372092.jpg><h2><strong>10.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Unfollow People Who Make You Insecure &nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Whether it’s the one fashion blogger who only posts bikini shots, a specific celebrity, or Victoria’s Secret’s Instagram, stop following people whose social media photos make you feel less than, even for a second. Social media is supposed to fun, not make you feel less sexy.</p><h2><strong>11</strong><strong>. Touch Yourself<br></strong></h2><p>Yeah, we’re going there. People&nbsp;who masturbate know exactly what they like when they’re intimate with someone else, which only increases their sex appeal.</p><h2><strong>12. Find A Good Tailor<br></strong></h2><p>When clothes are too boxy, too long, or generally ill-fitting, it looks like you’re trying to cover up your body, which&nbsp;intrinsically&nbsp;translates&nbsp;to generally un-sexy.&nbsp;No need to prance around in skin-tight numbers, but a well-fitting dress with a nipped waist and a&nbsp;flattering&nbsp;hemline, a blazer that skims your body (and whose sleeves aren’t too long), or pair of slim well-fitting jeans that just hit your ankle will show your figure in a way that’s sexy&nbsp;without being overt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gettyimages-500529714.jpg><h2><strong>13. Invest In Chic Specs</strong></h2><p>Need reading glasses? No shame in that! But&nbsp;it’s a known fact that most drugstore readymades aren’t the most youthful. Instead, seek out a modern pair at sites like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">EyeBuyDirect</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Eyebobs</a>. Of course, it’s worth getting an eye exam to make sure you don’t need a stronger prescription, in which case, your chic-specs options will be even larger thanks to hip affordable eyewear sites like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Warby Parker</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Glasses.com.</a></p><h2><strong>14. Stop Plucking Your Eyebrows</strong></h2><p>Full brows are associated with youth, while super-thin eyebrows can give your face a harsh appearance. As we age, our eyebrows gradually thin, but quitting the tweezers and using makeup to fill them in&nbsp;can&nbsp;work wonders, and completely change your face for the better.</p><h2><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Undo Yourself A Bit</strong></h2><p>Unbutton&nbsp;one extra button on your blouse, smudge your eyeliner, spritz&nbsp;some salt spray in your hair—sometimes appearing as if&nbsp;you just had fun in bed can make you feel—and look—extra-sexy.</p><h2><strong>16.&nbsp;Slow Down</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>According to sex coach Sean Jameson</a>, slowing down your movements and your speech by around 10 percent can make you sexier now. For example, instead of rushing down the hallway, slow down and accentuate your movements. Another example: When you’re making a point, don’t wave your arms about quickly and erratically, or&nbsp;ever feel like you have to get every word out of your mouth as quickly as possible.</p><h2><strong>17.&nbsp;Initiate Sex More<br></strong></h2><p>This one is sexy in the literal sense: Even if you’re not tremendously assertive,&nbsp;<a title="8 Big Mistakes You’re Making in Bed" href=#>initiate sex more often with your partner</a>. This is hot in and of itself, but it’ll also imply to your partner than you truly enjoy sex, which is one of the biggest turn-ons.</p><h2><strong>18. Use Touch</strong></h2><p>A killer way to get a person’s attention in a sexy way?&nbsp;Touch&nbsp;them very subtly on the arm or the back when you’re saying hello or goodbye, when you agree with something they’ve said, or if they’ve said something funny.</p><h2><strong>19. Wear Heels<br></strong></h2><p>One of the quickest ways to feel sexier? Slip on a pair of heels. Not only do they give you an empowering boost, but the&nbsp;right heels can make your clothes hang better, and—especially if they’re the color of your skin—can have a leg-lengthening effect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/how-to-be-sexy-nude-pumps.jpg><h2><strong>20.&nbsp;Challenge Yourself</strong></h2><p>Whether it’s at work or even something as small as taking an advanced fitness class instead of a beginner one, succeeding will you give you an air of confidence which will travel with you, making you&nbsp;much sexier.</p><h2><strong>21.&nbsp;Don’t Only&nbsp;wear Sweats to Bed<br></strong></h2><p>Obviously, comfy clothes are amazing, and—after a long day—there’s nothing better than chilling out in sweats. However, if you notice that your sex life is either lackluster or non-existent, swap out the sweats once in a while for something that&nbsp;<a title="Extremely Sexy Lingerie That Won’t Make You Cringe" href=#>makes you feel sexy.</a>&nbsp;If you feel it, your partner will feel it, too.</p><h2><strong>22. Let Your Natural Scent Do the Work&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>It’s not surprising that scent plays a big role in sex appeal, but—despite what perfume companies would have you believe—your best bet isn’t piling on a cloud of scented spray. In addition to good hygiene habits, a subtle spritz of a musky scent is fine, but&nbsp;you should be letting your natural pheromones shine.</p><h2><strong>23.&nbsp;Use Sexy People to Your Advantage, Rather Than Compare Yourself&nbsp;to Them</strong></h2><p>Instead of&nbsp;comparing&nbsp;yourself to others who you think are sexy, take cues from them instead. For example, stop bemoaning the fact that you’re not as tall, thin, or busty&nbsp;as a Victoria’s Secret model, and start using things you know make them sexy to your advantage. This might mean taking an extra 30 minutes in the morning to create the same bombshell waves&nbsp;in your hair, getting a light spray tan, or rocking a push-up bra on date night.</p><h2><strong>24. Try New Things<br></strong></h2><p>Whether it’s a taking a dance class, trying a new restaurant in a new neighborhood, or booking a last-minute weekend getaway, trying new things can absolutely make you feel sexier.</p><p>“Novelty is the greatest aphrodisiac,” Sandor Gardos, Ph.D., and founder of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">mypleasure.com</a>&nbsp;told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Redbook</a>, and we couldn’t&nbsp;agree More: Living in the moment is&nbsp;exciting&nbsp;and&nbsp;sexy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gettyimages-490710904.jpg><h2></h2><h2><strong>25. Nix Panty Lines</strong></h2><p>Speaking of underwear, panty lines are never, ever sexy. Everyone should invest in nude, seamless underwear, or a good thong. Trust us on this one.</p><h2><strong>26. Be Kind<br></strong></h2><p>No matter what you look like,&nbsp;nothing will&nbsp;knock your innate sex appeal down faster than being rude to people. You don’t need to—for lack of a better phrase—kiss people’s ass and be phony, but&nbsp;treating&nbsp;everyone—waitstaff, friends, new people, your elders—with basic kindness and respect is an attractive quality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gettyimages-510757098.jpg><h2><strong>27. Get A Manicure and Pedicure</strong></h2><p>Much like getting your hair blown out, it’s often the small indulgences that make us look and feel our best, so making time for on a pro mani-pedi once in awhile can do wonders. You can skip the polish of you want, too.</p><h2><strong>28. Get A Spray Tan</strong></h2><p>Likewise, having a healthy&nbsp;glow not only makes most people feel sexier, <a title="How To Look Skinny in Pictures: 12 Tips That Work" href=#>but it also has a slimming effect</a>.</p><h2><strong>29.&nbsp;Travel In A Pack<br></strong></h2><p>Anyone who’s watched “How I Met Your Mother” knows that Barney Stinson often references the “cheerleader effect,” when average-looking women appear more attractive as a group. Turns out, he may be onto something: People do come off as more attractive when they’re part of a clique&nbsp;than they do alone, according to a study published in the journal&nbsp;Psychological Science. <a title="The One Foolproof Trick That’ll Instantly Make You Sexier" href=#>Read about it here!</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gettyimages-493525142.jpg><h2><strong>30. Hone Your Talents</strong></h2><p>Lots (and lots) of rock stars, writers, actors, and artists aren’t traditionally attractive, but there’s a reason why they seem so damn sexy: talent. There’s something primally attractive about someone with strong skills, so take time to develop whatever it is you’re gifted in.</p><h2><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Invest In Yourself<br></strong></h2><p>This doesn’t necessarily mean <a title="7 Reasons Why Money Can’t Buy You Style" href=#>spending a lot of money on material items like an It-bag</a>, but rather&nbsp;investing effort into the things you know for a fact make you look and feel sexy, whether it’s something small like some bras and underwear, something transformative like keratin treatments, or something brainy like&nbsp;signing up for a class.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gfdgg.jpg alt="how to be sexy sex appeal" width=723 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>32.&nbsp;Be Assertive</strong></h2><p>If you want something that you believe you deserve, if you know you’re correct, or if your date suggests going somewhere you don’t want to, speak up. Being assertive&nbsp;is different than merely being pushy, and happens to be&nbsp;a sexy—and admirable—quality. Wishy-washy can get real old, real fast.</p><h2><strong>33. Play Up Your Best Features</strong></h2><p>When it comes to our looks, we all have certain attributes we like better than others, so why not make them the first thing people see when they look at you? Got lips to rival Angelina Jolie? Play them up with gloss.&nbsp;Love your striking blue eyes? Make them pop with mascara, liner, and strong&nbsp;brows. Got great legs? Swap the boyfriend jeans for a pair of skinnies.</p><h2><strong>34. But Don’t Be Obsessed with Your Appearance</strong></h2><p>Put as much effort into your appearance as you want&nbsp;before&nbsp;you&nbsp;go out, but when you’re around people,&nbsp;focus your energy on making solid conversation instead of&nbsp;running to bathroom to brush your hair, reapply your&nbsp;lipstick, or check the mirror every five minutes. Overt vanity is not sexy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gfdgg.jpg><h2><strong>35.&nbsp;Turn on the Lights<br></strong></h2><p>Sure, it can be sexy and natural to have sex in the dark, but try keeping the lights on once in a while. Not only will this feel more spontaneous, but it’ll allow both of you&nbsp;to really see each other, which can be super-hot. Not loving the harsh glow of your bedroom lamps? Light a bunch of candles, or buy a dimmer.</p><h2></h2><h2><strong>36. Never Wear Things That You Can’t Walk, Eat, Breathe, or Talk In</strong></h2><p>Obviously, you always want to look your best, but wearing six-inch stilettos you can’t walk in, or a dress that’s so tight you can’t freely move around isn’t sexy at all.&nbsp;Instead, wear things you know look good on you but won’t hinder you from being cool, calm, and collected.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gettyimages-514584644.jpg><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2><strong>37. Put Your Phone Away<br></strong></h2><p>This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;big one: The act of obsessively checking your phone every two minutes could be a bona-fide deal breaker when it comes to sex appeal. There’s nothing ruder than trying to have a conversation with a person who’s constantly staring at their screens—wouldn’t&nbsp;you&nbsp;be put off if&nbsp;someone&nbsp;were paying more attention to&nbsp;their&nbsp;iPhone than to you? Being present is sexy. Being preoccupied is not.</p><h2><strong>38. Ask the Right Questions</strong></h2><p>On a date (or anytime you’re with another human, really) it’s a good bet that asking questions will always ensure flowing conversation. However, if you start grilling someone&nbsp;on politics, religion, their&nbsp;exes, or&nbsp;how much cash they&nbsp;pull in, you’re going to look nosy and abrasive, rather than sexy and seductive.</p><h2><strong>39. Don’t Be A Snooze-Fest</strong></h2><p>This might sound harsh, because&nbsp;we&nbsp;know you’re not boring, but if people&nbsp;ask you questions, and you give&nbsp;one-word answers, roll your eyes, or seem generally&nbsp;disinterested, you’re not doing yourself any favors. Even if you look like a supermodel, people are most turned on by stimulating conversation, eye contact, and personality.</p><h2><strong>40.&nbsp;Screw ALL OF THESE RULES<br></strong></h2><p>Loving yourself for who you are and being comfortable in your own skin is the sexiest thing in the world. Be yourself and your sexiness will shine through.</p><p>A version of this article was originally published in March 2016.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8uorZ5lo5rFcH6TbW9scV%2BdvLh506hkm51dqLK5xY4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-to-be-sexy.html&text=40%20Tips%20for%20How%20to%20Be%20Sexy&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-to-be-sexy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-to-be-sexy.html&title=40%20Tips%20for%20How%20to%20Be%20Sexy" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-to-be-sexy.html&title=40%20Tips%20for%20How%20to%20Be%20Sexy" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-to-be-sexy.html&title=40%20Tips%20for%20How%20to%20Be%20Sexy" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-to-be-sexy.html&description=40%20Tips%20for%20How%20to%20Be%20Sexy" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./adidas-samba-sneaker-trend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Did the Adidas Samba Sneaker Become 2022's It Sneaker">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./michael-galeotti-wiki-bio-married-wife-divorce-net-worth-daughter-death-bethany-joy-lenz-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Galeotti Wiki: Personal Bio - From Married Life to Divorce with Ex-Wife">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
