He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">grew up</a> in an Amish community in Apple Creek, Ohio. Not much is known about his formative years, though. People who knew Eli described him as a quiet and withdrawn man.</p><p class=align-left>Stutzman was married to Ida, but his wife died in a ban fire. She was pregnant at the time of her death. They also had a 10-month-old son, <a href=#>Danny</a>. According to Eli, his wife went to the barn to save milking equipment and collapsed. The death was ruled as an accident at the time.</p><p class=align-left>After his wife’s passing, Eli fell into depression. Later, he shaved his beard, going against Amish tradition and started using electricity at his residence. Shortly after, in 1982, Eli moved to Colorado with his son.</p><h2>How did Eli die?</h2><p class=align-left>Eli was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">found dead</a> in his apartment in Ft. Worth, Texas, on a Wednesday afternoon in 2007. According to The Tarrant County (Texas) Medical Examiner's Officer, Eli killed himself. The cause of death was a sharp force injury to the left arm.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0525f2ea2c1c9c24.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The Maury Travis story: Crimes committed, lifestyle, and cause of death</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Emergency personnel went to his home after a neighbour reported that Eli had not been seen for a while.

In the book, the author, Olsen, recounts the <a href=#>alleged murders</a> of Eli, including the barn fire near Dalton that claimed the life of Eli Stutzman's wife while she was pregnant. So, how many crimes is Eli Stutzman accused of?</p><h3>The barn fire</h3><p class=align-left>In 1977, Eli Stutzman’s wife perished in a suspicious barn fire. At the time, she was<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> eight months pregnant</a>. The death of his wife was ruled a tragedy, and he was not charged. However, considering the following events, many wonder whether his wife would have been the serial killer's first victim.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f502b1a028d64511.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Forrie J.

Glen had been shot numerous times. Later, <a href=#>police officers</a> found out that he was shot by his roommate, Eli Stutzman, but he had fled the state by the time of the discovery.</p><p class=align-left>Things even got worse on <a href=#>Christmas</a> eve later that year; people found a young boy's body by the side of the road in Nebraska. Unfortunately, the authorities could not identify the boy and state how he died. The case went cold for two years. Considering the boy's unidentified state, he was dubbed "Little Boy Blue."</p><p class=align-left>Readers Digest published a story about the case in 1987, which got the nation's attention. And a woman from Wyoming, who thought she knew the boy came forward. She claimed that she took care of him a few months before his father picked him up, days before he was found dead.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/97462ed706e465b9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Frances Cain?

Eli Stutzman had left his son with the <a href=#>family</a> in the summer of 1985 before returning in December. Police confirmed the boy's identity via a palm print.</p><p class=align-left>The authorities started looking for Eli, who was caught in Azle, Texas. The Amish serial killer claimed his son fell sick and died while driving from Wyoming to Ohio. Eli said he panicked and left the body in the ditch for "God to take care of him." He then went to Salina, Kansas, to meet his boyfriend.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, there was no evidence pointing towards Eli being the killer. He was only convicted of abandoning his child and failing to report a death. The <a href=#>crime committed</a> attracted only 18 months in prison, which he served.</p><p class=align-left>On the other hand, Eli was convicted of murder for Glen since he was the prime suspect. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison for killing Glen Pritchett.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/68c8f89bbc2bca9f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why is Bill Russell so famous?

The same year Eli's son and Glen died, David Tyler was shot outside his autobody shop. Dennis Slaetter was also murdered at the liquor store where he worked. All these people were close associates of Eli Stutzman.</p><p class=align-left>According to police records, David resided in Durango for three years and was one of the three owners of an automotive shop. He worked as a manager and mechanic. Tyler was openly gay and told friends he received death threats from someone who hated homosexuals. The threats scared him, and he had to carry a handgun.</p><p class=align-left>Dennis, on the other hand, was only two weeks away from earning a degree in industrial psychology from Fort Lewis College when he was shot dead.</p><p class=align-left>The police concluded that Dennis and Tyler knew each other, were drug users and were gay. Eli, the prime suspect in the case, was in Durango at the time of the murders and was also gay. Someone fitting his description was seen near Dennis' scene of death. However, Eli Stutzman was never charged with the murders because of a lack of evidence.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/89a7e705eedbff7a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Bob Saget?

Unfortunately, he doesn't have a film, but there is a book written about Eli called <i>Abandoned Prayers: The Shocking True Story of Obsession</i>. There is also a documentary on Investigation Discovery called <i>The Amish Serial Killer </i>that talks about the life of Eli and <a href=#>highlights the murder</a> he was convicted of and the ones he was suspected of.</p><p class=align-left>Olsen, the author of the book <i>Abandoned Prayers: The Shocking True Story of Obsession</i>, has been obsessed with Eli's life since he wrote the book, and he feels terrible that he never confessed or told the truth to anyone before he died. In addition, he believes that if Eli had been convicted of killing his wife, he wouldn't have had the chance to kill others.</p><p class=align-left>Eli's story also appears in <i>Deadly Devotion Amish Serial Killer</i>, which details his mysterious life and murders.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/61326fc7f7631692.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Jesse from NELK?
