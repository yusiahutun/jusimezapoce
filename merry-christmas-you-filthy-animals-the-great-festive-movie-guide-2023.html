By <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">going bigger</a>, deeper and weirder. In the follow-up to 2018’s Into the Spider-Verse, Miles Morales finds himself dragged into a dizzying network of near-infinite Spider-Men.

It isn’t hard to see why: this is a bright, fast, buzzy love letter to a character who hasn’t previously done very well when it comes to films. Like all the Mario games, the film is about a plucky plumber fighting a sort of mutant turtle. Happily, unlike the games, Princess Peach gets more to do than simply sit around waiting to be rescued.<br>Christmas Day, 9.45am, 4pm, Sky Cinema Premiere</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>Belfast<br></strong>Kenneth Branagh has a complicated relationship with <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Belfast</a>. He was born and spent the first 10 years of his life there, before his family moved to Berkshire to avoid the Troubles. Although he lost the accent, as part of a conscious attempt to assimilate, the city never left him. Belfast is Branagh’s love letter to his place of birth: a warm, joyous burst of nostalgia, shot in monochrome, set against a burbling disquiet.<br>Christmas Day, 1.45am, BBC Two</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>Respect</strong><br>A <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">biographical drama</a> about Aretha Franklin’s life and rise to fame. The story goes that this film couldn’t be made for years because no one could match Franklin’s raw power, but then Jennifer Hudson came along. If that’s true, it makes total sense. Hudson is on belting, blazing form here, almost singlehandedly propping up the entire enterprise.<br>Thursday 28 December, 9pm, BBC Two</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>Amazing Grace<br></strong>If your appetite was whetted by <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Respect</a>, BBC Two has much, much more Aretha Franklin for you, with two hours of TV documentaries followed by the premiere of Amazing Grace, a documentary film about the recording of Franklin’s album of the same name. Originally filmed by Sydney Pollack, the project was first delayed due to syncing issues with the audio and visuals, and then twice more thanks to numerous lawsuits by Franklin herself.

Featuring Oscar Isaac and Charlize Theron as pitch-perfect Morticia and Gomez Addams, this is a wild shaggy dog of a road trip story where the family travels America, Wednesday tries to work out if she’s adopted or not and Uncle Fester turns into a squid.

A great, slightly meta sequel about a greedy publisher trying to exploit the story of Peter Rabbit, it reinforces Domhnall Gleeson’s claim as the most underrated comic actor around.<br>Boxing Day, 3.15pm, BBC One</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>The Lion King<br></strong>Often called a <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">live-action remake</a>, despite being exactly as animated as its source material, Jon Favreau’s remake of the Disney classic still has a lot going for it.

Nevertheless, there’s still something deeply magical about this film. Obviously Hugh Grant clatters away with the whole thing as villain Phoenix Buchanan, but the rest is just as wonderful.<br>Saturday 30 December, 6pm, BBC One</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>The Boss Baby 2: Family Business<br></strong>If you have young kids, especially ones who wolf down whole episodes of the Netflix cartoon series as if it’s going out of style, this is a no-brainer. Like the previous Boss Baby film, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">the plot</a> doesn’t stand up to any scrutiny whatsoever, but it’s fun and it’s fast and it’s visually inventive, and Alec Baldwin gets to go full Jack Donaghy in the lead.<br>New Year’s Day, 11.15am, BBC One</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>Paw Patrol: The Movie<br></strong>Those parents who have been forced to endure several years of the Paw Patrol animated series will find your expectations rightly in the gutter for this <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">big-screen adaptation</a>.

But that’s what Anne Hathaway chose to do with <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">this 2020</a> Robert Zemeckis remake of the Roald Dahl novel.

Scheduled perfectly to ensure that the bloodiest bits happen on Christmas Day itself.<br>Christmas Eve, Film4, 10.50pm</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>Polite Society</strong></p><figure id=f98fbaa4-051a-4292-ab05-925f271271a3 data-spacefinder-role=showcase data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-5h0uf4><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Nimra Bucha and Priya Kansara in Polite Society.</span> Photograph: Parisa Taghizadeh/AP</figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>Nida Manzoor’s <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">martial arts comedy</a> is a colossal amount of fun; a whipsmart, genre-bending coming-of-age story about a British-Pakistani woman who dreams of becoming a stunt performer, largely because she wants to be like Eunice Huthard, the 1994 series champion of Gladiator. This week is quite heavy on martial arts films, but this is worth seeking out regardless.<br>Friday 29 December, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>Sisu<br></strong>Another movie that is only tangentially linked to Christmas. It’s a blood-soaked, gory, wild Finnish <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">war film</a> in the mould of First Blood, about a retired commando forced to kill his way through a colossal wall of Nazis. It’s a film stuffed with snapping bones and flying limbs, brutal to the point of parody. And the Christmas connection? It’s set in Lapland.<br>Saturday 30 December, 10.15pm, Sky Cinema Premiere</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>Stillwater<br></strong>Think “unemployed Oklahoma oil rig roughneck” and Matt Damon probably isn’t the first name to spring to mind. However, he’s surprisingly convincing in this rugged crime drama, one that sadly got lost in the weeks during lockdown. Had it not, there is every possibility that Stillwater would have opened up another avenue of Liam Neeson-style revenge thrillers for Damon.<br>New Year’s Eve, Prime Video</p><h2 id=old-faithfils>Old faithfils</h2><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>The Wizard of Oz</strong></p><figure id=1b29c567-a7ed-43a6-ae7b-9916311f42b3 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>The Wizard of Oz.</span> Photograph: Allstar/Alamy</figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>Few films feel as if they were made specifically for being on in the background while you snooze off a Christmas lunch, but <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">The Wizard of Oz</a> – in all its wonderful timeworn familiarity – lives up to the job. Truly intergenerational, this will be the last time this film will be shown at Christmas, before next year’s Wicked adaptation steals its thunder. Embrace it.<br>Christmas Day, 3.10pm, Channel 5</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>The Trouble With Angels<br></strong>When Hayley Mills wanted to break out of the box she found herself in after years of starring in Disney fare, she chose this. The Trouble With Angels is a 1966 comedy about a pair of rebellious schoolgirls trying to avoid trouble at a convent school. Aside from a climax that is literally too preachy, this is a fun little jaunt .<br>Christmas Day, 7pm, Talking Pictures TV</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>Raiders of the Lost Ark<br></strong>This year’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny was much better than its lousy box-office performance suggested, but this remains the definitive Indiana Jones film. To watch <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a> is to watch many, many people giddy that they’re being allowed to get away with this wildness. A romp about one man trying to stop the Nazis from becoming invincible, every action film made since Raiders owes it a debt of gratitude.<br>Boxing Day, 6.50pm, Channel 4</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>Gone With the Wind</strong></p><figure id=d4681189-4bb5-4636-b5c0-21cb1f5e5187 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Vivien Leigh and Hattie McDaniel in Gone With The Wind.</span> Photograph: Silver Screen Collection/Getty Images</figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>It’s worth getting up early to watch this, the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">most popular film</a> ever made. When adjusted for inflation, Gone With the Wind has made over three billion dollars globally, which isn’t bad going for a movie about a frustratingly annoying woman and her uncomfortably happy slaves. Lots of films have aged better, but this is still a very important one.<br>Wednesday 27, 8.45am, Channel 5</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>Police Academy<br></strong>If you were around in the 1980s, you might remember that they made a Saturday morning kids’ cartoon out of Police Academy, a movie that was full of swearing, smoking, female nudity and implied oral sex. Channel 5 is showing the movie over Christmas, at noon. Expect it to either be heavily censored or wildly inappropriate.<br>Thursday 28 December, 11.50am, Channel 5</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>The Ten Commandments<br></strong>Almost 70 years old and Cecil B DeMille’s <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">gargantuan epic</a> is still a gift to television schedulers everywhere, who can just bung it on in the middle of the day and watch smugly as it fills an entire afternoon. Running from 1.10pm to 5.30pm, this is the story of Moses (Charlton Heston) with maximum attention given to pure mid 20th-century spectacle.<br>Thursday 28 December, 1.10pm, Channel 4</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>Harry Brown<br></strong>At the time of its release in 2009, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Harry Brown</a> was positioned as a cousin to Get Carter, in that they both feature Michael Caine deciding to take justice into his own hands. In truth, this movie is really more of a Gran Torino, as it is about a man with a violent past who struggles to function in the world. Still, nice to have this version of Caine around.<br>Friday 29 December, Disney+</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>Funny Girl</strong></p><figure id=7e1b5780-baf5-4add-8df4-2272d100814b data-spacefinder-role=showcase data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-5h0uf4><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Barbra Streisand in Funny Girl.</span> Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/Columbia/Allstar</figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>Someone at the BBC has clocked that Barbra Streisand has a memoir out this Christmas, as it’s devoted an entire afternoon to her. Presented in a double bill with 1969’s Hello, Dolly!, Funny Girl was Streisand’s first film, and still her finest hour. Charming and weird and heartbreaking in equal measure, Streisand essentially used Funny Girl to change the face of what a leading lady could be.<br>Friday 29 December, 4.05pm, BBC Two</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>Game Night<br></strong>John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, who specialise in making films that are far better than they have any right to be, wrote and directed this incredible, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">ambitious comedy</a> – a riotously silly riff on David Fincher’s The Game – about a group of people whose game night spills out of control and seeps into the criminal underworld. Everyone is on top form here: it is almost universally the best film that anyone in its cast (which includes Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams) has ever been in.<br>Friday 29 December, 12.10am, BBC One</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>Zulu<br></strong>Cy Endfield’s <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">epic retelling</a> of the Battle of Rorke’s Drift was such an enormous hit on release that it stayed in cinemas for 12 years. Zulu is also notable for introducing the world to the talents of Michael Caine.

Cyd Charisse’s endless gravity-defying scarf. Donald O’Connor destroying his body in the name of entertainment. The way that Good Morning grows and grows into an all-out extravaganza.
