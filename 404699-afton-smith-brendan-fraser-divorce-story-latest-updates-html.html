But how did the two film stars meet? And what was the main reason behind their divorce story?</p><h2>Who is Afton Smith?</h2><p class=align-left>Afton Smith is an American film star and author. She was born on <a href=# title="Afton Smith" rel="nofollow noopener">December 3, 1967</a>. Notably, her ex-husband was born exactly a year after her. Her hometown is in Northport, Long Island, New York.</p><p class=align-left>Not much is known about the actress' early life, but she studied in a Los Angeles' high school and graduated in 1985. Four years later, she completed her college course and graduated from Upper Canada College.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1cd134c43c6ba9c4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Katie Holmes: Tom Cruise divorce story, dating, children, wedding</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Afton started her acting career in 1987, starring in Less than Zero alongside other notable personalities like Jami Gertz, James Spader, and Robert Downey. She also appeared in Once Again, where she portrayed the character "Girl in Disco."</p><p class=align-left>Since her debut, <a href=#>the star</a> has appeared in several other TV series and Afton Smith's movies. Her talent and dedication to the art brought her to the limelight in the first place, not her ex-husband, which most viewers and fans believe.</p><h2>How did Afton meet her ex-husband Brendan Fraser?</h2><p class=align-left>Afton and Brendan met on July 4 1993. Both were present at Winona Ryder's home during a <a href=# title="Afton Smith" rel="nofollow noopener">barbecue party</a>. The lovebirds worked in George of the Jungle in 1997. Afton's role in this movie wasn't as significant, but it's probably her most famous character. On the other hand, Brendan took up the main actor's role in this successful movie.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/faad0f26a780a0fa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert divorce story: What really happened</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1cd134c43c6ba9c4.jpg><p class=align-left>Most details about their dating life are private, but the two were engaged four years later, in October 1997. The couple tied the knot in 1998. Their wedding took place at the Bel Air Hotel Garden.</p><p class=align-left>During their marriage, the couple was blessed with three children. Afton Smith's kids' names are Holden Fraser, Leland, and Griffin. They were born in 2006, 2004, and 2002, respectively.</p><h2>Afton and Brendan's divorce story and legal battles</h2><p class=align-left>Nine years into the marriage, the couple decided to call it quits. It was Brendan's publicist who communicated the development in December 2007. However, he reassured fans that Afton and Brendan would continue maintaining a caring and close relationship.</p><p class=align-left>The two had been struggling with relationship problems for quite some time, and in April 2008, the divorce proceedings commenced. By then, Fraser was among the top Hollywood stars, while Afton was a homemaker. Brendan was ordered to pay monthly alimony of $50,000 alongside an additional $300,000 every year as child support.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0bc4671e747ea4b0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rosemary Margaret Hobor: What you never knew about John Candy's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 2013, Brendan <a href=# title="Afton Smith" rel="nofollow noopener">requested the court</a> to reduce the annual child support and alimony totalling $900,000, citing that he was no longer professionally active as before. In response, Afton noted that he still earned $3 million annually and should continue providing the initially stated amount. The court case has since been addressed.</p><p class=align-left>After the couple separated, Afton has never revealed her later affairs or who she's dating. But from the look of things, the actress seems to enjoy her single life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/faad0f26a780a0fa.jpg><h2>Where is Afton Smith now?</h2><p class=align-left>Following the publicized separation from her husband, Smith continued residing in Los Angeles. However, she is away from the public eye and seems more concerned about raising her kids.</p><h2>Afton Smith's net worth</h2><p class=align-left>Though her financial information is scarce, Smith's net worth is about <a href=# title="Afton Smith" rel=noopener>$3 million</a>. Her ex-husband, on the other hand, is worth <a href=# title="Afton Smith" rel="nofollow noopener">$20 million</a>.</p><h2>Quick facts about Afton Smith</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ee42afc994523e9b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jean Muggli: 5 quick facts about Michael Strahan's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Do you wish to learn more about Afton Smith's other endeavours?

While still married to Brendan Fraser, Afton wrote and published a book called Hollywood Picks the Classics: A Guide for the Beginner and the Aficionado. This was in 2004.</p><p class=align-left>Also, Afton was an accomplished actress already. Before meeting Brendan, Afton was already actively involved in the <a href=#>entertainment</a> scene.
