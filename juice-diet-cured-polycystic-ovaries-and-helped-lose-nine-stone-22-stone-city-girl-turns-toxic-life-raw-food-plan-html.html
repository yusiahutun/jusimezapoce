A friend of mine gave me a book as a gift.&nbsp; It was Jason Vales 7lbs in 7days and I was immediately insulted! ‘Are you trying to say that I am fat..!?’ I thought.&nbsp;<br></span></p><p><span>'Once I had gotten over it I worked my way through that book and dabbled in a few juices. Eventually I made it to a raw retreat in Turkey and suddenly I was hooked.</span><br></p><p><span>‘I lost more than 10lbs in a week! It was an unbelievable wake up call for me that even though I had PCOS I could lose weight, even though I had previously been told there is ‘no cure’ and that it would be incredibly difficult to lose weight without medication.’</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>‘As the weight falls off the more capacity the body has to heal. It’s a wonderful cycle.’</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>Stephanie now eats what she describes as a high plant-based high raw diet.</span><br></p><p><span>‘I carry my juicer everywhere. I lug it across London in a cool bag if I’m on the move. Wherever I go my juicer goes.’</span><br></p><p><span>‘I have so much to be thankful for. I have cured myself from polycystic ovaries and a wonderful side effect has also been that I have lost lots of my weight. Which is blissful!</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>‘My skin is glowing and I look and feel much younger than I have for years. Looking back at old photos I hardly recognise myself.’</span></p><h3 class=wocc><b><span>Typical daily menu </span><span>for Stephanie (when not on a full detox)</span></b><br></h3><p><span><b>Around 7am/on rising </b>– ginger tea: hot water with lemon, raw fresh ginger and sometimes some raw honey I drink as much ginger tea as I fancy throughout the day</span><span>.<br></span></p><p><span><b>Around 8am</b> - Breakfast – green juice -&nbsp; 2 golden delicious apples 1 cucumber 1 peeled lemon 1 peeled lime&nbsp; blended with two or three large fistfuls of greens (spinach or kale etc.). If I am not in the mood for a juice (which is rare!) I might have some chia pudding – which is chia seeds soaked in home made almond milk and served with honey and fruit. </span><span><br></span></p><p><span><b>Throughout the morning </b>– green waters – water with a teaspoon of ‘green powder blend’ such as wheatgrass, spirulina, chlorella and barleygrass. </span><span><br></span></p><p><span><b>Around 11am/Mid morning snack </b>– if needed – stuffed dates: organic medjool dates stuffed with wet activated almonds (soaked in water overnight so they are softer, more easily digestible, enzyme rich and tastier).</span><span><br></span></p><p><span><b>Around 1pm/ Lunch</b>- Salad for example: 10oz or large bag of kale, Juice 1 lime 1 tsp. Himalayan pink salt, 1 tbsp. virgin olive oil, 1 tsp. linseeds, 1 tsp. sesame seeds, 1 pinch pine nuts.&nbsp; ‘Make love to the Kale! – using a large bowl massage the kale with the lime juice, salt and olive oil until the kale is soft and wilted but not too limp. Remove any final stalks or tough bits as you feel them.</span></p><p><span>Mix in the linseed, sesame seeds and a big pinch of pine nuts. The portion for this dish is one cup per person. But I tend to eat as much as I feel I need. Served with blueberries and perhaps a toasted pitta bread (not raw!)</span><span>.<br></span></p><p><span><b>Around 3pm /Afternoon snack</b> – if needed some organic fruit or vegetables, bananas, apples, oranges, carrots, cucumbers...</span><span><br></span></p><p><span><b>Around 6pm/ Supper</b>- for example: Raw Curry – recipe serves 4: 1 cup soaked cashews (soak in filtered or pure water for at least two hours) 2 cups or more of filtered water, ½ chopped red onion, 6 organic cherry tomatoes, 10 sundried tomatoes (soaked or if from a jar then washed) juice of half a lime, ½ cup desiccated coconut, 1 ripe avocado, 1 inch ginger peeled and grated 1½ tsp. cumin, 1 or 2 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1 tsp. paprika, 1 tsp. turmeric, 1 tsp. garam masala 2 clove organic garlic.<br></span></p><p><span>Basically blend until a smooth paste is formed and serve! Sometimes I might let it sit in a bowl in the oven with the door open on low if I don’t fancy eating it at room temperature. Served with salad or rice. (you can serve with cooked rice or make ‘raw rice’ by putting half a cauliflower in the food processor – chop finely so it resembles rice and add a handful or pine or other nuts).</span><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn6UbmlybWNkl7a1wp5knaGVqXqkwdGem2aon6HGpMXSraCcZZ%2BrrrO1xKxkeoZ0YrWmuM%2Bem2akn6iybpqoh3xmq6Sku6Z5kWtkrKyfo7Jur8itsGafmae5bsDUq6WsZaSkxaqvjKWgn51dp664ecWopp1loKGur3rHraSl</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjuice-diet-cured-polycystic-ovaries-and-helped-lose-nine-stone-22-stone-city-girl-turns-toxic-life-raw-food-plan-html.html&text=Juice%20diet%20cured%20my%20polycystic%20ovaries%20AND%20helped%20me%20lose%20NINE%20stone%3a%2022-stone%20city%20girl%20turns%20%27toxi&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjuice-diet-cured-polycystic-ovaries-and-helped-lose-nine-stone-22-stone-city-girl-turns-toxic-life-raw-food-plan-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjuice-diet-cured-polycystic-ovaries-and-helped-lose-nine-stone-22-stone-city-girl-turns-toxic-life-raw-food-plan-html.html&title=Juice%20diet%20cured%20my%20polycystic%20ovaries%20AND%20helped%20me%20lose%20NINE%20stone%3a%2022-stone%20city%20girl%20turns%20%27toxi" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjuice-diet-cured-polycystic-ovaries-and-helped-lose-nine-stone-22-stone-city-girl-turns-toxic-life-raw-food-plan-html.html&title=Juice%20diet%20cured%20my%20polycystic%20ovaries%20AND%20helped%20me%20lose%20NINE%20stone%3a%2022-stone%20city%20girl%20turns%20%27toxi" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjuice-diet-cured-polycystic-ovaries-and-helped-lose-nine-stone-22-stone-city-girl-turns-toxic-life-raw-food-plan-html.html&title=Juice%20diet%20cured%20my%20polycystic%20ovaries%20AND%20helped%20me%20lose%20NINE%20stone%3a%2022-stone%20city%20girl%20turns%20%27toxi" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjuice-diet-cured-polycystic-ovaries-and-helped-lose-nine-stone-22-stone-city-girl-turns-toxic-life-raw-food-plan-html.html&description=Juice%20diet%20cured%20my%20polycystic%20ovaries%20AND%20helped%20me%20lose%20NINE%20stone%3a%2022-stone%20city%20girl%20turns%20%27toxi" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kristen-bell-edgy-black-leather-dress-special-night-out-broadway.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kristen Bell stuns in edgy black leather dress for special night out">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./green-bean-salad-with-pickled-red-onions-and-fried-almonds-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=green-bean-salad-with-pickled-red-onions-and-fried-almonds>Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
