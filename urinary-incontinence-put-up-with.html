"As a former GP, I saw hundreds of women experiencing incontinence and being gaslit and led to believe it's what they should expect.</p><p id=esybTDfyyV5 data-wc=49>"I saw a woman last week in her mid-fifties, who has six children, and her incontinence was so bad she won't go anywhere because she's frightened people will think she smells.

"I don't want women's lives to be limited by them wondering, 'How is my vagina going to feel today?'," Dr. Sarah says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bd27ba19029a-dr-sarah-jenkins.jpg><p id=e9Lvz4fBuzX data-wc=39>As well as working hard to help women understand the variety of intimate treatments that can help with incontinence, vaginal atrophy and dryness, Dr. Sarah also wants to rubbish the belief that intimate treatments are there for aesthetic reasons.</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Intimate rejuvenation treatments: need to know</h3><p id=eQOvvj7hLp>Not just about aesthetics, intimate treatments can help with several issues.</p><h3><strong>For incontinence: EmpowerRF</strong></h3><p id=ezOROK5p_l8>EmpowerRF combines radiofrequency and electrical muscle stimulation to help those who suffer from stress incontinence due to laxity. &nbsp;Post-treatment, you will experience reduced leaking during everyday activities such as sneezing or jumping</p><p id=eazXflYqB9Y>"The appearance of the vagina may also appear more youthful, with many commenting that their vagina ‘looked like it used to'," says women's health expert Dr. Shirin &nbsp;Lakhani.</p><p id=eNqeleyRenZ>"There are different elements to the treatment," explains Sarah, who had EmpowerRF to help with her pelvic floor. "An anatomical-shaped applicator goes inside the vagina and provides intravaginal electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) to rehabilitate weak pelvic floor muscles. You lie on the treatment couch with it inside for half an hour. "It is a strange sensation but not uncomfortable. I had a series of treatments over several weeks," Sarah says.&nbsp;</p><p id=elL49ixa5vi>Morpheus 8V is also part of EmpowerRF. It uses radiofrequency microneedling to improve laxity and helps with tightening to also address urinary frequency and urgency. "It is a more uncomfortable treatment than the V-tone, but tolerable, especially as I had numbing cream for the second and third treatments," says Sarah.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7ff7cad6faa4-dr-shirin-164-1.jpg><h3><strong>&nbsp;For vaginismus: Botox&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=eW2Y3oqGlpI>"Botox can be injected into the vagina under local anaesthesia to help with vaginismus, a medical condition that causes involuntary vaginal muscle spasm. Botox can also help vulvodynia, persistent pain in the vulva and pelvic floor issues," says Dr. Shirin.</p><h3><strong>For dryness: Hyaluronic acid filler</strong></h3><p id=e92xa7b7TLcK>&nbsp;"Hyaluronic acid, contained in filler and found naturally in the body, can rejuvenate vaginal tissue by increasing the thickness of the vaginal walls, which can improve sexual function and dryness," says Dr. Shirin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/83ac94d9a145-womans-health-3.jpg><h3><strong>For total rejuvenation: Ultra Femme 360</strong></h3><p id=eT7v0JdL6mEL>&nbsp;"The Ultra Femme 360 can also be used to provide complete vaginal rejuvenation both internally and externally, including labial remodelling and vaginal tightening," says Dr. Shirin.</p><p id=e9mi2eMn9L1S>"It’s a fast and effective treatment for vaginal laxity, tissue quality and incontinence. By stimulating collagen growth and blood vessels and nerves we can effectively treat the symptoms that are often causing us to have less libido than we should have.</p><p id=ep4tR7nMSN-l>"My clients tell me that Ultra Femme restored their confidence. One woman, who was suffering with vaginal laxity after four vaginal births and also experiencing problems with her pelvic floor, said she would tell all ladies she knows to go for it.</p><p id=e1VG_SUnOZ3U>&nbsp;"Some of these treatments may sound painful, but you will be given either a topical anaesthetic to numb the area or injected with anaesthetic so you will not feel it.</p><p id=e2bjQOazHVBS>"Some find the intimate nature of the procedure a little daunting. If you have any questions or concerns, I encourage you to discuss them with your practitioner. There’s no need for embarrassment or feelings of anxiety.”</p><p id=eGfdWXSkOBR>"Don’t feel embarrassed, and don’t panic or worry about anything because it’s not embarrassing. It’s your body, it’s your life. This procedure could make your life so much better."&nbsp;</p><p id=eqhN-WjZQHd data-wc=32>She introduced us to the concept of vulva filler.

The filler draws moisture to the areas to make it comfortable and cushioned again, providing the natural lubrication that is lost as we age.</p><p id=ej2ykv-Mr9 data-wc=13><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>What a women's health expert wants you to know about vaginal prolapse</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eCQ-MVSBqg1 data-wc=41>Vulva fillers can also change the appearance of the area, but Dr. Sarah is quick to reassure that intimate treatments are rarely aesthetically driven. "This is not on a basis of aesthetics, and it's not to sexually please men," she enthuses.</p><p id=ejbSFX1ZYhU data-wc=38>That said, Mary, who underwent Morpheus8V to tone her pelvic floor, shared: "Following my treatment, I'm back to my confident self, so much so I have started dating again and even had sex without worrying about wetting myself."</p><p id=eVlKN1eJmvX data-wc=35>Of how her life has improved, Mary added: "I can take long journeys and enjoy life again without worrying about wetting myself. I feel like I did before children and even my sensitivity has improved."</p><p id=eXxtDvwBjRva data-wc=16>Here's hoping Dr. Sarah's work to destigmatise intimate health treatments will help more women seek help.</p><p data-wc=9 id=eWlMhCxvVR><a class=hm-link href=#>Visit HELLO!'s Out Loud hub for more taboo-busting stories</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
