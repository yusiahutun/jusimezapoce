The late&nbsp;<a href=#><b>Tina Turner</b></a><span> was known for her singing, songwriting, dancing and acting, but she was also the mom of four kids. The congress was survived by two kids who are alive after <a href=#>her death in May 2023</a> at age 83.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Tina Turner,” read the statement shared on May 24. “With her music and her boundless passion for life, she enchanted millions of fans around the world and inspired the stars of tomorrow. Today we say goodbye to a dear friend who leaves us all her greatest work: her music. All our heartfelt compassion goes out to her family. Tina, we will miss you dearly.”</p><p><span>The iconic </span><i><span>What’s Love Got to Do With It</span></i><span> star was the doting mother of children </span><b>Ike Turner Jr</b><span>. and </span><b>Michael Turner</b><span> and late sons Ronnie Turner and </span><a href=#><span>Craig Turner</span></a><span>.</span></p><p>The “We Don’t Need Another Hero” songstress became a mom for the first time when she was just 18 years old. Tina and Raymond Hill, a saxophonist who played for the band Kings of Rhythm, welcomed their eldest son, Craig, in 1958.</p><p>The new mom and dad were thrilled to experience parenthood, but their relationship didn’t last long as they split shortly after. In 1960, Tina started seeing Ike Turner, who was the frontman of Kings of Rhythm, and they expanded her family when they welcomed their son, Ronnie, that same year.</p><p>Two years after Ronnie’s birth, Tina and Ike tied the knot in 1962, and following their nuptials, the “Proud Mary” singer adopted his two kids, Ike Jr. and Michael, whom he shared with ex-wife <strong>Lorraine Taylor</strong>. Ike also adopted Tina’s eldest son, Craig.</p><p>Tragically, Tina’s eldest son, Craig, died by suicide in July 2018. At the time, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner told <a href=#>People</a> that Craig died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being found in his California home.</p><p>A year after her beloved child’s death, <a href=#>Tina opened up about the devastating loss</a>. Even though the Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome actress was heartbroken over the tragedy, she believed Craig is in a “good place.”</p><p>“I think Craig was lonely, that’s what I think really got him more than anything else,” she candidly shared with <a href=#>CBS News</a> in July 2019. “I have pictures all around of him smiling, and I think I’m sensing that he’s in a good place. I really do.”</p><p>Like her other kids, Tina always held a special place in her heart for Craig. <span>On December 9, 2022, Ronnie’s wife, </span><b>Afida Turner</b><span>, announced his death on Instagram. He was 62. “This is a tragedy,” she captioned several photos with her late husband. A cause of death was not immediately revealed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to learn more about Tina’s children.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46toKeZXanCs7rEq6pmo5mZwG65xJ6rZqCVp3p1ecKhoKWcopq7brXNnKOunJmjtG64wK2cZqufo3qkvsCinmg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftina-turners-kids-meet-her-4-children-including-late-son-craig.html&text=Tina%20Turner%27s%20Kids%3a%20Meet%20Her%204%20Children%20Including%20Late%20Son%20Craig&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftina-turners-kids-meet-her-4-children-including-late-son-craig.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftina-turners-kids-meet-her-4-children-including-late-son-craig.html&title=Tina%20Turner%27s%20Kids%3a%20Meet%20Her%204%20Children%20Including%20Late%20Son%20Craig" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftina-turners-kids-meet-her-4-children-including-late-son-craig.html&title=Tina%20Turner%27s%20Kids%3a%20Meet%20Her%204%20Children%20Including%20Late%20Son%20Craig" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftina-turners-kids-meet-her-4-children-including-late-son-craig.html&title=Tina%20Turner%27s%20Kids%3a%20Meet%20Her%204%20Children%20Including%20Late%20Son%20Craig" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftina-turners-kids-meet-her-4-children-including-late-son-craig.html&description=Tina%20Turner%27s%20Kids%3a%20Meet%20Her%204%20Children%20Including%20Late%20Son%20Craig" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cris-judd.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Cris Judd dating?
