That’s right — the fictional Catskills resort where the quintessential romance film Dirty Dancing took place. And we’re instantly whisked back to a time in our lives when we knew all the songs, all the dances and longed to spend our summers with the Dirty Dancing cast.</p><p>The 1987 cult classic chronicled an epic romance between college-bound Baby, vacationing with her family, and Johnny Castle, the dreamy, brooding and wildly talented summer dance instructor employed by the resort. The duo, who come from entirely different worlds, can’t deny their attraction toward each other, and the rest is romance movie history.

The then-27-year-old Grey took on the role of Baby, the upper-class daughter of a doctor who finds herself vacationing at Kellerman’s resort in the summer of 1963 with her parents and sister. One evening, she stumbles upon a staff party (with a watermelon in tow), where they’ve all come together to — you guessed it — dirty dance. It’s there where Baby formally meets Johnny, played by Patrick Swayze, and their relationship blossoms.</p><p>In a 2022 interview with Entertainment Weekly, when asked if she ever got tired of talking about the film, Grey said, “I actually am not. You know why? Because there are so many layers to this movie. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">There is so much goodness under what feels like a fluffy rom-com fairy tale.</a> There is so much depth in the structure of the characters, and the relevance to what’s going on right now.”</p><p>Outside of Dirty Dancing, Grey is known for her work in films like Ferris Bueller’s Day Off and Red Dawn. She has a daughter with Clark Gregg, who she was married to until 2021. In 2022, she released her memoir, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Out of the Corner</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Patrick Swayze as Johnny Castle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Copy-of-side-by-side-32.png><p>Heartthrob dance instructor Johny Castle was played by Patrick Swayze, known for other iconic roles in films like The Outsiders, Roadhouse, Point Break and Ghost. After a successful and accomplished career, he tragically passed in 2009 at the age of 57, following a battle with pancreatic cancer.</p><p>With a Dirty Dancing sequel in the works that Jennifer Grey is set to star in, she told People that there’s no re-creating the chemistry between her and Swayze, despite the tension between them during filming: “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">All I can say is&nbsp;there is no replacing&nbsp;anyone who’s passed</a> — you never try to repeat anything that’s magic like that,” she said. “You just go for something different.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cynthia Rhodes as Penny Johnson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Copy-of-side-by-side-33.png><p>Penny Johnson was played by Cynthia Rhodes. Penny was a pivotal character in the film, as her accidental pregnancy with privileged waiter Robbie catapulted Baby and Johnny into each other’s lives, as Baby was forced to replace Penny in one of her and Johnny’s dance routines at another hotel.</p><p>Rhodes’ work outside of Dirty Dancing included roles in Flashdance, Staying Alive and Runaway. She married singer-songwriter Richard Marx in 1989 and after becoming a mother, took a step away from the spotlight. The couple has since divorced in 2014 after having three beautiful children together.</p><p>In an interview with People in 2014, Marx said of Cynthia, “What I will say is that I had the great fortune and blessing to not only be married to Cynthia for all those years but to just share her company. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">There’s not a finer human being</a>. I’m very grateful that we were together, had three amazing sons and I can’t say enough about what an amazing person she is and how lucky I was to share that time with her.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jane Brucker as Lisa Houseman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Copy-of-side-by-side-37.png><p>Baby’s temperamental and feisty older sister, Lisa, was played by Jane Brucker.

And to the longtime ones, I promise we will not ruin your childhood.
