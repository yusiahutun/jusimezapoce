But you may also have found yourself captivated by something else: the location.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fans of the film have been flocking to Drayton House (the mansion which served as Felix Catton's ancestral home, and the film's main shooting location) in their thousands; one TikTok video that shares directions of how to access a public footpath that runs through the middle of the estate has netted over 400,000 views.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But where exactly is the real-life Saltburn made quite so popular by the film?

You'd be forgiven for thinking the maze – famously a focal point of the film – is a star attraction, but this was actually erected in the grounds for filming and dismantled when the crew left.</p><img alt=saltburn title=Saltburn width=3000 height=2252 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sltb-2023-fg-00313217-still546-r-3000-65a7b2f2eef84.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Amazon Prime</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The estate (which was recently valued by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.agentadvice.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Agent Advice" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Agent Advice</a> at roughly £42.5 million) is situated in the sleepy, Northamptonshire village of Lowick and is typically closed to the public. The location "needed to be something that hadn’t been used before. This hadn’t been photographed even, let alone put on film," <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/saltburn-mansion-house-real-drayton-b2473869.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">said</a> Saltburn's director, Emerald Fennell.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We always wanted the exact sense that it is a real place.

To the people who live here it’s just home and it’s just funny. These grand things are just the clutter of your everyday life.

He and his family are famously private, so the estate is usually closed to the public – although <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.northamptonshiresurprise.com/historic-houses/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="guided tours and private parties can be arranged by appointment" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">guided tours and private parties can be arranged by appointment</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Stopford-Sackville – who is a friend of Fennell's family – only agreed to the house being used as the location for Saltburn, so long as its name was never mentioned on screen. But a surge of interest in the home after the film's success has left him both bemused and with his privacy invaded.</p><img alt=saltburn title=Saltburn width=3000 height=2252 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sltb-2023-fg-00395911-still675-r-3000-65a7b31e7317a.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Amazon Prime</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I never envisaged the amount of interest there would be.

"I don't take it as flattering. How would you feel if people were taking pictures outside your house? I'd prefer the interest to blow over." Stopford-Sackville added that the family have encountered numerous trespassers since the film's release, and that they have had to increase security around the property. "Most people are fairly good, but some get a bit inquisitive, let's say." The generous fee offered by the producers did "100 per cent" influence his decision to allow the mansion to be used as a film location, he said, explaining that "these houses don’t run on water".</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As for what he thinks of the famously controversial film, Stopford-Sackville said that a few of the more outlandish scenes weren't quite to his taste. "There were bits that I liked and bits that I wouldn’t necessarily have put in myself," he said. "But it’s not my film, it’s Emerald's film."</p><img alt=saltburn title=saltburn width=4000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/saltburn-3-655c78807229c.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">EPK</span></p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How was Drayton House transformed into Saltburn?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The house's private ownership turned out to be a bonus for Fennell and her team: generally, English heritage laws forbid the alteration of period buildings during filming – in this case, however, the owners gave their blessing to Fennell and the production designer Suzie Davies to change the interiors where required. The TV room, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/dec/08/the-real-saltburn-and-10-more-scene-stealing-stately-homes-from-films data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="for instance" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">for instance</a>, is usually a breakfast room, and Davies ripped up the carpet, added silk panels and painted it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The team <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cntraveller.com/article/inside-the-enchanting-home-where-the-madness-of-saltburn-all-goes-down data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=added class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">added</a> topiary, art and sculptures, and brought in furniture from Lots Road Auctions in London. Some of the modern artwork was created by the art department, but the team also got permission to reproduce pieces by artists including Ryan Mosley and Colin Harris, and created portraits of the Catton family that can be seen throughout the house.</p><img alt=saltburn title=Saltburn width=3000 height=2250 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sltb-fg-1600-r-3000-65a7b3433eda5.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Amazon Prime</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"In a National Trust or English heritage site, I wouldn’t be able to go near it!"

Felix and Oliver’s bedrooms are actual rooms in the house, but were altered for cinematic effect. "We flipped them around, painted them, took tapestries down, and put them back up," Davies says. "We turned a bedroom into a bathroom and a bathroom into a dressing room." In the shared bathroom that connects Felix and Oliver’s rooms – and yes, where that scene was filmed – a bath was made especially to accommodate Jacob Elordi’s 6ft 5in frame.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then, of course, there was the pivotal party scene. "We just went for it," says Davies. "We had some music on and we had a riot dressing it. We planned it within an inch of its life, anyway. We had a team doing greens, a team doing sculptures, a team doing the nightclub. It was a crazy ride." A vibe that – if you've seen Saltburn – you'll know is clearly reflected in the film itself.</p><img alt=saltburn title=saltburn width=4000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/saltburn-2-655c7880a3fe7.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">EPK</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSwtrjTrqmeZZ6axLR7wG1tbWlpbINxe9Kao62apae7br7EmqNmoJ%2BqwKZ7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsaltburn-real-house.html&text=the%20real-life%20location%20of%20the%20cult%20film&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsaltburn-real-house.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsaltburn-real-house.html&title=the%20real-life%20location%20of%20the%20cult%20film" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsaltburn-real-house.html&title=the%20real-life%20location%20of%20the%20cult%20film" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsaltburn-real-house.html&title=the%20real-life%20location%20of%20the%20cult%20film" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsaltburn-real-house.html&description=the%20real-life%20location%20of%20the%20cult%20film" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brandon-bochenski.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Brandon Bochenski dating?
