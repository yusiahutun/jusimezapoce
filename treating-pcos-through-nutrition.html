Try to exercise more and eat healthier, you’ll be fine,” my doctor—and virtually everyone—told me when I tried to find answers behind my steady weight gain that started a few years ago.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I had just started working my first full-time job out of college and was noticing a ton of changes in my body: major fatigue, anxiety, irregular periods, sharp pelvic pains and the most noticeable, weight gain. All of which I was told were issues related to my transition from college into the working world. So I listened and tried to exercise more and eat healthier, only to frustratingly gain more weight no matter what I did. I was also hospitalized twice for ruptured ovarian cysts, something I thought was an entirely separate issue, because when I told doctors and my OB-GYN about my mysterious, sharp pelvic pain that came every month, their response was simply “cysts are normal, go on birth control and you won’t get them.” No tests, no explanations—just birth control pills shoved in my face.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Thinking this was my only option, I tried going on birth control only to have bad reactions to the pills (extreme nausea and an insane spike in my hormone levels that left me feeling completely insane). I decided that, for me, I would choose dealing with painful cysts instead of feeling that way on the pill. Deep down, I also knew there was something serious going on in my body and I refused to use birth control as a quick band-aid fix to the symptom (cysts), instead of actually curing the problem. It took another two years and countless doctors to finally confirm that it wasn’t all in my head: I was officially diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a chronic hormonal endocrine disorder.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I wasn’t given any information or guidance—just birth control pills shoved in my face."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sadly, this isn’t uncommon.

(You must have at least two of its three key features—<span class=redactor-unlink>ovarian cysts</span>, higher levels of testosterone, and irregular or missed menstrual periods—to be diagnosed.) Afterwards, I wasn’t given any information or guidance, except the recommendation of birth control and the cryptic, “you might not be able to get pregnant naturally,” message my doctor nonchalantly slipped into our conversation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But my journey trying to treat PCOS on my own soon led me to Alisa Vitti, a hormone nutritionist, founder of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.floliving.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Flo Living" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Flo Living</a> and the author of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/WomanCode-Perfect-Amplify-Fertility-Supercharge/dp/006213079X data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Woman Code" data-vars-ga-product-id=8e7cee47-4647-47dd-b568-ebb72c6be4f4 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/WomanCode-Perfect-Amplify-Fertility-Supercharge/dp/006213079X data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/WomanCode-Perfect-Amplify-Fertility-Supercharge/dp/006213079X data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/WomanCode-Perfect-Amplify-Fertility-Supercharge/dp/006213079X data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=3b83a3bc-49b7-4015-852c-228a07bc08d3 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Woman Code</a>, a guide for women on how to rebalance hormones through food-based programs. Vitti herself had been diagnosed with PCOS 20 years ago and has since treated her symptoms through food, supplements and self-care. After reading her book, I began working with Vitti to come up with a food-based plan to treat my symptoms.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During our first consultation, Vitti asked me for my symptoms along with an example of what my "normal day" of meals looked like. After I ran her through a typical day of eating (and by "typical," I mean I chose a healthy day instead of a day that ends in pizza and a night of drinking), I was shocked to hear that my idea of "eating healthy" was actually backfiring against me and my symptoms.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"You're cutting out an entire food group!" Vitti exclaimed when I proudly told her my normal breakfast (eggs), lunch (salmon and spinach salad) and dinner (chicken and veggies). "You can't just cut out carbs entirely. That's why you're always hungry and reaching for snacks like pretzels and chips," she explained. Instead, she suggested that I add half a cup of complex carbs like quinoa, brown rice or sweet potatoes to both my dinner. Along with fueling me, those carbs also help to manage blood sugar levels (women with PCOS typically have insulin resistance, so monitoring your blood sugar is key). So step 1: add in healthy carbs—check.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another quick fix for my eating plan from Vitti was to bulk up my breakfast by adding a serving of (good) fat and vegetables to my eggs in order to keep me full until lunch. A breakfast that’s high in fats (an avocado, almonds, wild caught salmon, for example), can help to stabilize blood sugar throughout the day, and has been <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1334192/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="shown to improve symptoms" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">shown to improve symptoms</a> of PCOS. "Instead of having a breakfast of oatmeal with fruit or something carby that’s going to burn off fast, we have people do the opposite. The fat stabilizes blood sugar spikes that you’re otherwise going to get throughout the day."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span></span>Vitti also recommended snacking on six almonds (a good source of fat) instead of pretzels (which, okay fine, duh) and trying coconut yogurt with raspberries as an after dinner snack. Easy enough.</p><img alt="Text, Font, Line, Document, " title="Text, Font, Line, Document, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-period-week-index-pcos-02-1498601650.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bazaar</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But then came time for the terrible, nightmare-inducing news: if I wanted this thing to work, I would have to quit caffeine. I'm not going to lie to you and say that when Vitti told me I'd have to give up my greatest love, iced coffee, I considered hanging up and forgetting this whole thing. But she is incredibly convincing—and inspiring (as referenced in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKRj9yV8pI" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="her TED Talk" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">her TED Talk</a>)—so I gave the idea a chance. As it turns out, my coffee addiction (consisting of two to three large iced coffees a day) was apparently making all my PCOS symptoms 10,000 times worse. "Caffeine stimulates the production of insulin, and therefore contributes to irregular blood sugar levels," explained Vitti. "<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3277302/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="PCOS and insulin resistance" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">PCOS and insulin resistance</a> go hand and hand."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This was the first change in Vitti's food-based plan that immediately changed the way my body felt. While Vitti suggested weaning myself off caffeine and trying a week of black tea followed by a week of green tea, I decided that for me, it would be easier to quit cold turkey—rip it off like a band-aid. After five days of insanely terrible caffeine withdrawal (headaches, shakes and crying every time a coffee passed me on the street), I finally started to feel amazing: more energy, no more 3 p.m. crashes and even brighter skin. Step 2: Quit insane coffee addiction—check.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As for my other vice, alcohol, I had to make some changes in that department too. Vitti instructed me to stay away from beer altogether and to try to have as little hard liquor as possible. "Beer is full of gluten and pesticides—both of which are endocrine disruptors. Hard alcohol is super concentrated sugar and has a higher alcohol content. It will disrupt both blood sugar/insulin levels and make the liver more fatty," Vitti said.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I finally started to feel amazing: more energy, no more 3 p.m. crashes and even brighter skin."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This was kind of a problem for me as I had just given up my coffee habit. I had to draw the line at giving up my beloved vodka sodas and margaritas entirely, too. So as a general rule of thumb, Vitti told me to keep my drink intake to no more than two drinks at a time. Having one glass of wine, champagne or sake with food is okay, she noted, because they have less sugar and less alcohol concentration—so they won't disrupt your blood sugar levels as much. But because sometimes one margarita turns into four and a glass of wine can turn into a bottle, she gave me a post-drinking routine to follow: Anytime after drinking two or more alcoholic drinks (which is often if you're a New Yorker), drink a serving of electrolyte enhancer (<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002HWRY5S data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emergen-C Electro-Mix" data-vars-ga-product-id=f54c9bb7-faa3-4331-ba51-ab199e1501d5 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002HWRY5S data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002HWRY5S data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002HWRY5S data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand=Emergen-C data-vars-ga-product-price=$9.14 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=c7345c2b-da1d-43b0-9cc1-becf591f637b data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=Emergen-C data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Vitamin C" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Emergen-C Electro-Mix</a> is good) in a glass of water before you go to bed. Along with the drink, take an extra B-vitamin complex to help recover faster from dehydration. The bonus here is that along with keeping your body in check, I noticed that this little remedy also acts as a hangover preventer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The types of food and beverages you're consuming isn't the only thing that matters, though—it also matters what time and how frequently you're eating. According to Vitti's Woman Code plan, I needed to eat my breakfast within 30 minutes to an hour of waking up. Lunch should then be consumed within three and a half hours of breakfast, followed by a mid-afternoon snack within two hours. Lastly, dinner should be eaten around three hours after your snack. Skipping meals is an obvious no as it ends up slowing down your metabolism and, again, screwing with your insulin levels.

In both Vitti's book and on her app, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://myflotracker.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=MyFlo class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">MyFlo</a>, she guides you through the four phases of your cycle: the follicular phase (when follicles in the ovary mature as they get ready to release an egg); the ovulatory phase (when your ovaries actually release an egg); the luteal phase (when the lining of your uterus prepares for a possible pregnancy); and the menstrual phase (when you have your period).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Based on where you are in your cycle, there are certain foods and exercises you should be focusing on. While this sounds like an incredibly difficult time commitment, it's actually really simple. For example, during your luteal phase, you should focus on adding foods rich in B vitamins to combat sugar cravings and leafy greens to reduce bloating. There is no strict diet plan to follow, it's all about weaving certain food groups into your diet based on what cycle your body is in.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During this entire process, what I learned is that I truly didn't know anything about how my body changed depending on my menstrual cycle. And how would I? Girls are never taught this in school—I certainly wasn'tand once it's time for the OB-GYN, their advice is almost always to go on birth control and that's that. Regardless of whether you have a hormone imbalance, PCOS, or another period-related issue, Vitti's Woman Code gave me the tools to actually understand how my body operate as women. Step 5: sync your life to your cycle—check.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"Two months in, the most exciting result is that I finally cracked the code on losing weight with PCOS."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Two months into my diet and lifestyle change, the most exciting result is that I finally cracked the code on losing weight with PCOS. Weight loss—and control—with PCOS is nearly impossible due to hormone imbalances and insulin resistance. In just over two years, I gained a total of 20 lbs (a significant increase on my 5'2" frame). After three years of trying everything to lose weight (more cardio, Atkin's, cleanses, you name it) and not ever losing a pound, I managed to lose a total of four pounds in just two months—a huge feat for someone with PCOS.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At the beginning of my journey, Vitti told me that because I'm still in my twenties and have been suffering from PCOS symptoms for three years, it should only take about three months of being on her plan to reverse my symptoms. As I entered my third month last week, I felt distinctly better (both mind and body) and was finally able to lose weight for the first time in three years (which is HUGE), however I was still dealing with painful cysts. When I told Vitti, she suggested upping my magnesium intake during my luteal phase along with taking <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NH5AK2S data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Evening Primrose Oil" data-vars-ga-product-id=664a83ad-7328-4968-9890-00c0430cd804 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NH5AK2S data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NH5AK2S data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NH5AK2S data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand="Sports Research" data-vars-ga-product-price=$21.95 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=13ac6f93-3c5c-49b2-a0a8-11400cd30ccb data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Sports Research" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Evening Primrose" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Evening Primrose Oil</a> as a fix, which I'm currently in the process of trying out.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As a full disclaimer, I am not someone who's good at sticking to diets, exercise or even remembering to take vitamins on a daily basis. In my first three months of trying to naturally combat PCOS, there were plenty of times I forgot to take my supplements for three days in a row, had too many vodka clubs after dinner, or totally forgot to add specific foods into my diet based on my cycle. But even following Vitti's plan only, let's say 60 percent of the time, I still managed to see results. And the entire process of working with a functional nutritionist like Vitti gave me eye-opening insight into my own body. It's a reminder that, despite what your doctor tells you, birth control isn't always the only answer—especially to a problem like PCOS.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/765453da-3fc9-4650-8bff-01664371711e_1704808979.png alt="Headshot of Lauren Alexis Fisher" title="Headshot of Lauren Alexis Fisher" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Lauren Alexis Fisher is the Senior Editor at Cosmopolitan, overseeing digital content across fashion, lifestyle, beauty, sex, and culture.
