It was to give people personalized training for better results. The company won the award of the AFS Fitness Business of The Year for its tremendous work serving thousands of fitness facilities worldwide with millions of members.</p><p>It’s not a coincidence that Alloy programs are among the most effective programs in the world today for helping people who want to look and feel their absolute best.&nbsp;</p><p>The company has established effective fitness programs and business management solutions that deliver results all over the globe. In addition, the Franchise also gives franchisees a chance to impact their community and future with a branded, brick-and-mortar Alloy Personal Training franchise location.</p><p>Over the past few decades, as people become more aware of their need to be fit to avoid chronic diseases, The demand for <a href=#>fitness services</a> in the US has grown significantly. With about 174 million clubs spread all over the world, The health club industry is worth more than $96 billion, according to Statista.&nbsp;</p><p>Franchising is a great business model that enables people to get into their own business while relying on the experience and tools of experts like those at Alloy. Research shows people are happier and more fulfilled when they are in business for themselves. Franchising can help people achieve those goals with less risk.&nbsp;</p><p>The Alloy Personal Training Franchise business model prepares franchisees, owners, and operators to be ready for the fitness industry’s resurgence. The Alloy franchise model allows it to be an outstanding example for the future fitness industry.</p><p>The model is based on capacity and keeping a safe, healthy, and efficient environment for clients. The underlying short and long-term trends support Alloy’s growth proposition. More importantly, their unit economics sets them apart.</p><p>When evaluating any business opportunity, customer retention and lifetime value, profit margin, and the ratio of investment to revenues are important metrics to consider. Alloy’s retention rates and revenues per member are some of the highest in the industry, and our startup investment requirements are quite reasonable.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Difficulties at the Start:</h3><p>Rick Mayo, CEO of Alloy Personal Training Franchise, has been around in the fitness space for nearly 30 years. He soon realized that it wasn’t possible to develop the brand to its full potential without offering a complete solution.</p><p>Franchising allowed them to help their business partners much more effectively. The team at Alloy can supply the entire business model from build-out design through equipment, fitness operations, marketing, specifications, and more.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Triggering Point of Growth:</h3><p>In 2019, Mayo started Alloy Personal Training Franchise.&nbsp;</p><p>Its customized client programs, business systems, and technology tools grew to serve over 2,000 licensed existing gym and fitness facilities worldwide.</p><p>Mayo shifted from the licensing model and launched the Alloy Personal Training franchise in 2019. This change of strategy enabled Alloy to deliver a turnkey franchise opportunity encompassing the entire personal training business model from build-out design, equipment, business systems, technology platforms, and marketing under the Alloy brand.&nbsp;</p><p>The Alloy Personal Training Franchise management team takes the same amount of pride in training a new personal training franchise owner as they do one of our personal training club members.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019 he and the Alloy brand were awarded Fitness Business of the Year by the Association of Fitness Studios.</p><p>This personalization aspect is especially critical when we consider the future of the fitness industry. As people migrate to gyms and boutique studios with varying goals, injuries, priorities, and desires.</p><p>The gyms that cater to people’s personalized and specific desires will continue to grow in the upcoming years.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Growth Quotient</h3><p>“The name ‘Alloy’ was created under the notion of strength and motion meeting; those two things coming together to create something bigger, stronger, and longer-lasting,” says founder Rick Mayo. “Over the past few years, he kept asking himself- how our team and brand could do more to meet our mission; the answer became clear, we needed to create a total solution.”&nbsp;</p><p>It was in 2018 that Rick and the team at Alloy Personal Training Franchise decided that moving into a franchise model was the answer they sought.&nbsp;</p><p>“We know a formula that works, and that is a key ingredient to a successful franchise.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Until now, gym operators picked and chose the parts of the Alloy systems they needed to fill in gaps in their personal training programs.Alloy Personal Training Franchise helps them build from the ground up, and they can provide total support for their systems, as proven in thousands of gyms worldwide.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Long-Standing Success-</h3><p>Over the years, Alloy’s programs have been powering a variety of gym locations and fitness systems, providing Alloy training and tools to clubs across the globe. Their best practices are refined, and systems are time-tested. Their commitment is unmitigated.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Alloy has:</h3><ul><li>A superior personal training system, with most sessions at a coach-to-client ratio of 1:6 or less.</li><li>A concept known for getting optimal results in the least amount of time for people of all ages, ability levels, or injury histories.</li><li>Customized workout plans that change with each client visit to provide maximum variety; no workout is ever repeated twice.</li><li>Tracking tools to monitor each client’s workout frequency and intensity to track progress toward established goals.</li><li>Accountability appointments are included with membership, plus additional motivation and guidance.</li><li>Alloy is unique. The first-ever personal training center.</li><li>Among the Highest retention rate in the industry</li><li>Established brand: Alloy has been in business since 1992 and has had over 2,000 white-label licensing agreements.</li><li>Loyal customer base: Alloy delivers the accountability customers need while providing a better fitness experience that improves loyalty.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Products and Services:</h3><p>Alloy’s fitness program was created around a very simple concept: people who receive personalized coaching get better results.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, Alloy programs are among the most effective programs in the world for helping people who want to look and feel their absolute best. Teamed with exercise physiologists, an onsite Doctor of Physical Therapy, a registered dietician, and other advisory board behavioral specialists, and with ample experience bringing fitness education and training systems to markets around the world and with speaking engagements at countless industry events, we have created a program where cutting- edge science meets real, in-the-trenches experience. Therein lies the Alloy magic formula for world-class fitness programming.</p><p>A real advantage for a person interested in getting involved in fitness and personal training is identifying a concept like Alloy Personal Training Franchise, which has figured out a proven niche. By offering a turnkey package, we can help entrepreneurs realize their dreams and reduce their risk. That is one of the great advantages of franchising in general.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Road Ahead-</h3><p>Alloy’s experience in their original location in Alpharetta, Georgia, combined with their work with so many fitness professionals, has led them to define a very specific strategy that they have been building on for a long time. We’d like to think we know a formula that works, and that is a key ingredient to a successful franchise.</p><p>“Knowing the formula that works is a key ingredient to a successful franchise.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Makes Alloy a Unique Franchise Concept?</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Targets Underserved Customer Demographic-</h3><p>Alloy’s customer target market is a population that has been underserved. Their customer avatar is like what a one-on-one personal training business might target around 45 to 65 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>Traditionally 45 to 65 hold more discretionary income. Most fitness specialty boutiques, large health clubs, and group fitness class-based programs target 30-year-olds and a larger number of members.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Safer Workout Environment With Fewer People Training</h3><p>After the pandemic, there was a resurgence of people wanting to return to in-person fitness workouts in a safe environment rather than working out remotely. People want socialization again.&nbsp;</p><p>So, the brick-and-mortar fitness concept is evolving with brands like Alloy Personal Training Franchise, where small groups of people train in a smaller facility allowing clients to work out with fewer people in a safe and clean environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Better Coach To Client Ratio</h3><p>Over the last 30 years, Alloy scaled their fitness business model by making personal training more affordable with small-group training. Currently, Alloy has a ratio of 1 coach to 6 clients.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Better Value With Small Group Personal Training</h3><p>Alloy’s average membership is about $30 per small group training session or around $300 a month. But if you look at their price of $30 a session compared to the one-on-one personal training price of $80- $100 per session, they are a good value for their target customer.</p><p>Typically, large fitness clubs have thousands of members that they need to maintain the large facility and staffing. A large number of members and larger fitness classes enable to keep the cost of the membership lower, but don’t offer the personalized training, attention, and accountability that an Alloy would provide.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Higher Retention Rates Lead to Higher Customer Lifetime Value</h3><p>Alloy Personal Training Franchise clients stick around longer, which results in Alloy having one of the highest retention rates in the industry. The average member stays around longer than in any other fitness model.&nbsp;</p><p>Their customer average stay is around 36 months. If you take the average membership of $300 a month, that’s a $10,800 lifetime value for that customer.&nbsp;</p><p>Alloy is over 10 times the lifetime value of a class-based boutique brand or a big-box health club. There is a lot of turnover in fitness clubs, and they constantly churn members while needing to bring new members into the facility.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. Franchise Business Coaching and Support</h3><p>Alloy supports franchisees with a better ratio of business coaches to each owner or operator. Alloy didn’t think that the typical ratio of in the franchise business is 80:1 (80 franchisees to one franchise business coach) in the franchise business would be enough, so they offer a 30:1 ratio (30 franchisees to one franchise business coach).&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>7. Higher Revenue Per Square Foot</h3><p>Alloy’s business model, developed with small group personal training, increased the business margins to be one of the highest revenue per square foot facilities in the country.&nbsp;</p><p>Originally, Alloy Personal Training Franchise started as a one-on-one personal training business. After they switched to small group personal training, other fitness facilities wanted our consulting guidance to learn our retention and revenue secret.&nbsp;</p><p>Then other businesses wanted to buy into their sales programs, operations, systems, and fitness programs, and that is why they started licensing their business model.&nbsp;</p><p>Alloy pivoted to franchising in 2020. In 2022, they now have over 50 franchises awarded because of their success with a unique franchise business model.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>9. Scalable Business Model</h3><p>Alloy’s franchise concept with the target client allowed them to make the model scalable. They have many franchisees owning multiple locations because it is scalable, allowing for economies of scale.&nbsp;</p><p>Alloy’s Personal Training Franchise concept, training, and support allow an owner to be confident and profitable, with a manager running day-to-day operations at each facility while they run multiple locations.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rick Mayo- Leading The Way for Alloy Personal Training Franchise</h2><p>Rick says, the keys to success as an entrepreneur are many, but the most important are tenacity and knowledge. As the great Thomas Edison was quoted as saying, “Many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.” Great entrepreneurs never give up.&nbsp;</p><p>As to knowledge, that is what franchising represents, the chance to benefit from others’ knowledge and experiences. The famous engineer W. Edwards Deming once said, “ It is not enough to do your best; you must know what to do and then do your best.” Knowing exactly what to do is as important as never giving up, said Rick Mayo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZK6tuM6yZKmdoqi8r63LZqurmZmjtq%2BzjJ%2BpmqaTnba0sQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2falloy-personal-training-franchise.html&text=Alloy%20Personal%20Training%20Franchise%20%7c%20Rick%20Mayo&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falloy-personal-training-franchise.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2falloy-personal-training-franchise.html&title=Alloy%20Personal%20Training%20Franchise%20%7c%20Rick%20Mayo" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2falloy-personal-training-franchise.html&title=Alloy%20Personal%20Training%20Franchise%20%7c%20Rick%20Mayo" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2falloy-personal-training-franchise.html&title=Alloy%20Personal%20Training%20Franchise%20%7c%20Rick%20Mayo" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falloy-personal-training-franchise.html&description=Alloy%20Personal%20Training%20Franchise%20%7c%20Rick%20Mayo" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gail-o-grady-and-richard-dasko.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gail O'Grady and Richard Dasko">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./page.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="red bean chili">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
