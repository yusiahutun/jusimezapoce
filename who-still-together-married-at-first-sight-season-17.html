In it, Orion reveals: “I guess we really didn’t talk to everybody since the honeymoon, but Lauren, and I,”—then he emphasizes “I”—”have decided to get a divorce.” Lauren herself, repeats “I”, suggesting she didn’t have much of a say in their breakup.</p><p>“I was called a failure in the marriage,” Lauren told him. “You’ve never apologized for the way you made me feel. You did not even apologize for calling me a failure. And that I felt in this marriage of her, not having your bag. So don’t sit here and say you’ve apologized for those words.” Orion said in response: “Well, I don’t think you have failed,” to which Lauren called him a “gaslighter”. Hmm, it’s not looking good.</p><p>We can’t locate them on social media so we don’t know for absolutely sure if they’ve plit. Still, in an episode that aired on December 6, 2023, Orion confessed that he’d “lost all romantic interest” in Lauren after learning she had sex with someone else two months before they walked down the aisle (i.e. before they met). Dr. Pia asked him: “Orion, how does control show up in your life for you?” He replied: “Well, I’m not trying to control what’s happening by calling for a divorce.”</p><p>Dr. Pia continued: “You are. You feel uncomfortable. So your part of control is to remove yourself from it. I do feel confident that a repair is possible but you are protecting yourself. That’s a certain level of vulnerability that you have closed off right now. … Whether y’all are married to each other or anybody else, there’s going to be many uncomfortable moments. And I really don’t want to see you all give up on one another.”</p><p>During a one-on-one conversation, Orion and Lauren discussed his shifting feelings. “I feel so horrible that I’ve put you in the predicament to lose romantic attraction to me because through this, I have maintained my romantic attraction to you,” Lauren told Orion. “But if you don’t feel like you have it in you to do it, I don’t want to twist your arm. I don’t want to force you to stay with me.”</p><p>Orion said he had no desire to repair their relationship, despite their chemistry. “There is no doubt that there is chemistry between us and when we are, you know, avoiding the big topics or trying to navigate around them,” he explained. “Yes, I mean, everything is great. But there is no romance within me anymore.” He added: “After the honeymoon, taking time and just this conversation and where I’m feeling and where I’m at, I want to continue to follow through with wanting a divorce.”</p><p>In one teaser clip <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>supplied to ET</a>, Lauren candidly shared her thoughts on her sexuality, saying, “I’m not really big on labels, but I would say if I had to identify as anything it would be queen. I love men. I enjoy women, but I really just want to be married to a man.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Orion said during his confessional. “If my potential spouse identified as queer, it wouldn’t bother me. In Navajo tribes, we have a coming of two souls, masculine and feminine,” he says. “I have explored that feminine side when it came to going on a date with a man, but that was also like the door where it was like, ‘I’m not gay.’ You know, things like that. I feel like if you don’t explore those, or you don’t explore your own curiosity, it’s just too binding.”</p><p>The show’s host Kevin Frazier asked a panel in a special episode titled&nbsp;Kicking Off Denver how Orion and Lauren might fare. “With this particular couple, I think they might be able to explore those interests together, because maybe in other circumstances she was paired with another guy there’d be no way. But if they’re communicating and they’re honest, and they both understand, who’s to say what they might go off and do and play with and explore.”&nbsp;Another panelist added, “I think this couple is going to make it. There’s no doubt he’s going to appreciate all she brings with her fluidity.”</p><p>However, a teaser suggested that maybe there’s trouble ahead. “I think it is really amazing how well we got matched together by the experts,” Orion observed, but then the tone totally shifted. “I don’t feel comfortable with the fact that… you know… you did sleep with somebody else,” he says in a different scene with Lauren, who admits, “I did.”</p><p>While nobody uses the word “cheat”, it does suggest there could be some trust issues between them. “I did feel myself falling for him and now I’m just like, well… what the f—?”&nbsp;In another scene, Orion is shown saying: “I am just really feeling quite broken.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfrLWwedKtoKWkXam8qLHToZyrZZ2Wv7O1xJ1kmqxdm7azv9NmqqKfmKl6tLHArKanZWFsfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-still-together-married-at-first-sight-season-17.html&text=Who%27s%20Still%20Together%20From%20Married%20at%20First%20Sight%20Season%2017%3f%20MAFS%202023&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-still-together-married-at-first-sight-season-17.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-still-together-married-at-first-sight-season-17.html&title=Who%27s%20Still%20Together%20From%20Married%20at%20First%20Sight%20Season%2017%3f%20MAFS%202023" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-still-together-married-at-first-sight-season-17.html&title=Who%27s%20Still%20Together%20From%20Married%20at%20First%20Sight%20Season%2017%3f%20MAFS%202023" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-still-together-married-at-first-sight-season-17.html&title=Who%27s%20Still%20Together%20From%20Married%20at%20First%20Sight%20Season%2017%3f%20MAFS%202023" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-still-together-married-at-first-sight-season-17.html&description=Who%27s%20Still%20Together%20From%20Married%20at%20First%20Sight%20Season%2017%3f%20MAFS%202023" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./zayn-maliks-rare-confession-about-daughter-and-how-becoming-a-dad-changed-him.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zayn Malik's rare confession about daughter and how becoming a dad changed him">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./adam-guettel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Adam Guettel dating?
