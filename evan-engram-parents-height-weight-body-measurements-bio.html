He was ranked 23rd overall by the New York Giants and was the second tight end selected in the draft. Engram had an amazing year in college and was ranked second-best tight end for the draft by Sports Illustrated and third-best tight end by ESPN and NFLDraftScout.com. Follow us as we guide you through Evan Engram’s life path to success in football.</p><h2><strong>Evan Engram Bio</strong></h2><p>Born as Evan Michael Engram on September 2, 1994, in Powder Springs, Georgia, Engram began playing soccer in his neighborhood and was one of the biggest boys in the area. However, when he came to Powder Springs (GA) Hillgrove, he encountered real competition and immediately became an outsider, so he had to work extra hard to get noticed.</p><p>Somewhere in high school, Evan somehow lost his way; he started partying too much and lying to his parents. As a result, his game was compromised. His mother discovered his bad behavior after she got her hands on his phone.</p><p>A turning point in his life came in his junior year after a confidential conversation with his mother outside a Walmart store. The conversation resonated deep within him and inspired him to clarify his priorities. Right after this conversation with his mother, Evan began a new journey to maturity. His Christian faith was also revived.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Evan-Engram.jpg><p>Evan Engram continued to experience the frustration of not having colleges looking in his direction. However, he stood firm and held on to his faith, and in time, Ole Miss came and requested his services, and Engram immediately committed himself. He became a starter from freshman year on, but soon the regular college schedules became boring and he became complacent. He was shaken up, however, when he gave up the rest of the season due to an ankle injury in his freshman year. Engram became more grateful and decided to take every chance he could get.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Rihanna Dating Timeline, Relationship History, Past Boyfriends</a></strong></p><p>By the end of his college career, Engram had 162 receptions over 2,320 yards, an average of 14.3 yards. After his selection in the 2017 NFL Draft, he was signed to a 4-year contract worth $10.71 million, with all money guaranteed and a signing bonus of $5.93 million.</p><p>Evan Engram has a younger sister, Mackenzie Engram, who played college basketball for the University of Georgia. She plays in the WNBA for the Atlanta Dream.</p><h2><strong>His Parents</strong></h2><p>Evan Engram was praised, in addition to his athleticism and ball skills, for showing an amazing personality whose most important traits are humility and compassion. The most important people to thank for Engram’s success and achievements to date are his parents, his mother Michelle Zelina, and his father Derrick Engram. His mother is white, while his father is of African-American descent.</p><p>Evan’s parents divorced when he was just 5 years old, but they remained actively involved in his upbringing and held him responsible for his behavior. Engram received his athletic genes from his father Derrick, who was a top athlete in his heyday as a football and basketball player. Derrick played at Rockledge High School and was highly sought after in colleges around the country. The fact that he had so many opportunities may have contributed to the fact that his career ended right after college.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Evan-Engram-Family.jpg><p>Evan’s father first played college football in Louisville and then at Brevard College (now East Florida). Next up was Bethune-Cookman before returning to Louisville. He went back to West Georgia and then to St. Thomas and Pikeville College before finally settling down at Life University in Marietta, Georgia. His jumping from one school to another earned him the nickname of the traveling mailman.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Paul Perkins Bio, Height, Weight, Body Measurements, NFL Career</a></strong></p><p>At Life University, Derrick played for the Running Eagle basketball team from 1991 to 1993. He graduated in 1993 with a bachelor’s degree in business administration. After college, Evan’s father was hired to play basketball for money, but he decided to pursue a corporate career instead.</p><p>Immediately after graduation, he began his career as Asst Director of Minority Recruiting at Life University, a position he held for 9 years before joining Pro-Build South to work as a Shipping Manager/Change Agent. He left the position 5 years later in 2011 to join the Leeward team as their VP of Business Development and Principal Consultant. He continues to work there to this day while also advising the DeKalb County Recorder Court.</p><h2><strong>Height, Weight, and Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>According to his player profile on the official website of the National Football League, Engram stands at a height of 1.91 m (6 feet 3 inches). His weight is 240 lb, which is about 109 kg. Compared to the body dimensions of an average tight end, Engram is rather small, but he is catching up with his miniature body at incredible speed. His pre-draft readings at the NFL Combine show his arm length at 33 1/2 in (0.85 m) and his hand size at 10 in (0.25 m).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ksretzWacp5%2BilrpuvMCrnKeso2K1prXGoatmr5WetKnAjJumnbFdorKiv9SrnKadnqnAbq7IqGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fevan-engram-parents-height-weight-body-measurements-bio.html&text=Evan%20Engram%20Parents%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Measurements%2c%20Bio&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fevan-engram-parents-height-weight-body-measurements-bio.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fevan-engram-parents-height-weight-body-measurements-bio.html&title=Evan%20Engram%20Parents%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Measurements%2c%20Bio" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fevan-engram-parents-height-weight-body-measurements-bio.html&title=Evan%20Engram%20Parents%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Measurements%2c%20Bio" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fevan-engram-parents-height-weight-body-measurements-bio.html&title=Evan%20Engram%20Parents%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Measurements%2c%20Bio" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fevan-engram-parents-height-weight-body-measurements-bio.html&description=Evan%20Engram%20Parents%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Measurements%2c%20Bio" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./madelaine-west-duchovny.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Madelaine West Duchovny">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./power-book-ii-ghost-brayden-and-tariq-friendship-fall-apart-season-3-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brayden and Tariq's Friendship Could Fall Apart in Season 3">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
