Community doctors, who were not necessarily trained professionals but brought in to deal with bodies, would wear beak-like masks filled with herbs to ward off the putrid smell. Dressed also in a wax cape and armed with a stick (to prod the bodies), they were a sinister sight indeed. “Really, people started wearing them in a medical context before they knew about the science of germs and how they spread. It was understood that the plague spread from person to person through human contact, but people thought it was circulating through society by demons and devils,” says Stevenson. Arresting and frankly scary, masks therefore became connected to a sense of spirituality, as well as protection.</p><img alt="unspecified circa 1900 giovanni grewembroch xviii century manuscript doctor in venice at the time of the plague watercolor photo by dea picture libraryde agostini via getty images" title="Giovanni Grewembroch - XVIII century.

The upshot being that masks – enabling disobedience and disruption - were outlawed in Venice by the Catholic Church for a number of years. During the Renaissance, however, masks started to be worn again on an everyday basis, this time not elaborate, she says - perhaps more akin then to the throwaway surgical ones we have likely found ourselves wearing lately.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Masks – enabling disobedience and disruption - were outlawed in Venice<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During the Spanish flu of 1918, reports from private journals and diaries noted that wearers actually became quite creative with their mask-wearing – in much the same way as the many thousands of makers and sellers of Etsy have done recently (sales have reportedly reached $346m). And the face mask has been commonplace in Asia for some time, owing to pollution. Off the catwalk, you’ll regularly clock the street style stars of Seoul Fashion Week wearing them with their Insta-garb, while on the catwalk, they pertinently cropped up at Marine Serre this past February when they still felt like a runway-only, avant-garde idea. Yet the breakout country singer Orville Peck has made a Wild West fringe style his trademark pre-pandemic for some time now.</p><img alt="paris, france february 25 a model walks the runway during the marine serre ready to wear fallwinter 20202021 show as part of the paris fashion week on february 25th, 2020 photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Marine Serre Runway - Fall/Winter 2020-2021 Paris Fashion Week" width=2837 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/marine-serre-1598264692.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor VIRGILE</span><p>Marine Serre autumn/winter 2020-21</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Accessories tell you a lot about what is going on in society at the time,” says Elizabeth Way, assistant curator at The Museum at FIT, who in a rather crystal ball moment began working on an exhibition with Melissa Marra-Alvarez, curator of education and research, two years ago called Head To Toe, about the history of women’s accessories, in which masks will now be a feature. “If you think about wearing masks, they conceal very expressive parts of our face – so on the one hand you have people wearing masks as a form of consideration and protection, but on the other they’re a symbol of solidarity. When you add this fashion layer to it, it’s also an outlet to share individuality,” says Marra-Alvarez.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But as Way points out: “In many ways they’re much more visible than other accessories on the face and we’re still at a point where we notice them. They definitely haven’t blended into the fashion or social landscape, they’re really noticeable.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>I feel suspicion and a lack of safety when I’m around anyone not wearing a mask<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Some designers are trying to combat the idea of the mask as a signal of danger or of poor safety. The US designer Raquel Allegra featured them in a recent lookbook – as did Versace – despite initially being put off by face coverings. “I did feel a strange kind of judgement. A feeling I’m not comfortable with at all. The judgement resembled something like ‘danger/keep away/not safe’. Surely this has roots in my instinct to survive. I now feel the complete opposite. I feel suspicion and a lack of safety when I’m around anyone not wearing a mask. They are a symbol of taking responsibility.”</p><img alt="raquel allegra" title="Raquel Allegra" width=682 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/raquelallegra-1598265165.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>Face mask by Raquel Allegra, £45</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">South Korean designer Jackie Lee, of J JS Lee, is inclined to agree. It was obvious to her to begin making masks for friends and family and supermarket workers in her immediate area back in March, but she was also met with hostility. “Are you sick?” she says is what people immediately thought when she wore one, and would receive strange glances - and even hate email suggesting she was stoking fear.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s a culture thing,” she says. When celebrities wear them, they look cool (and probably enjoy the anonymity), but bandanas have a relationship with bandits and bank robbers. “When you cover your face, it’s like you want to hide something,” she says. Notably, with today’s face masks that cover mouths and noses, it’s only the eyes left on display – and in the western world we’re not exactly great on eye contact. Just think back to your old commute. Even our emojis – happy, sad, stumped, lols - convey reactions by the mouth. “Asian emojis are all in the eyes,” points out Lee of the difference.</p><img alt="elsa hosk wearing a face mask" title="Elsa Hosk wearing a face mask" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/elsa-hosk-1598265296.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Gotham</span><p>Elsa Hosk wearing a face mask in New York in April</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not only is it about how we feel about wearing them, it’s what we use them to signal. “Masks are like the new T-shirts in that way,” says Elizabeth Way of their political potential – some celebrities, like Shia LaBeouf, have used them to show who they’ll be voting for in the upcoming presidential election. Stevenson compares them to the ubiquitous promotional tote bag.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The question is then: will we be stocking up on them in quite the same way?
