In fact, the London-born writer-director-producer thanked them first and foremost himself on Feb. 18 when he won Best Direction for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oppenheimer</a> at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the BAFTAS</a>, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards.</p><p>“This is an incredible honor being back home, getting this from BAFTA in the [Royal] Festival Hall where my mum and dad used to drag me to make me have some culture — and some of it stuck,” he quipped to the audience while accepting his honors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/2_5e7fd3.jpg><p>He of course went on to thank a list of people who worked on the Academy Award nominated film, including its star, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cillian Murphy</a>, who’s been a frequent collaborator on Christopher Nolan movies.</p><p>“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s always paid off for me, you know, in every film that I worked with [Nolan] on</a>,” Murphy recently told CBS News, and Oppenheimer proved no different: Murphy — the star of six other Christopher Nolan movies: Dunkirk, Inception, Transcendence, and his “Dark Night” Batman trilogy — has already scored Golden Globe and BAFTA awards for his lead role as Oppenheimer’s titular physicist, the man responsible for designing the atomic bomb.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>13 Fun Facts About the Academy Awards</a></p><p>Co-star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Emily Blunt</a>, who plays the scientist’s wife, Kitty Oppenheimer, was equally as eager to team with Nolan on the project. “He speaks to you privately and intimately. His notes are really transforming and he never comes in before three takes. He understands actors,” she told Vanity Fair, adding, “Honestly, the most beautiful part about the way he directs is the environment he creates for you just has no chaos. At all. None.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/3_517509.jpg><p>While winning raves from his cast is nice, seeing — and feeling — the impact his film made on audiences has been even more rewarding for Nolan. “Emma [Thomas, his producer and wife] and I went into the back of Lincoln Square [theaters],” Nolan, a 53-year-old father of four, told Empire about sneaking into a few early screenings. “It was absolutely packed; every seat was filled,” he recalls of observing the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Trinity test scene</a>. “To be in the back of that theatre in that moment of silence, before the sound washes over the audience… you could hear a pin drop. It was a really remarkable experience. Quite overwhelming, really.”</p><p>“The audience’s desire to be surprised, to see something new, to see something they did not know they wanted, that’s always been the most powerful force in theatrical film,” he added about what drives him to make the visually and emotionally engaging movies he creates.</p><p>Until we see what new and exciting Christopher Nolan movies are coming in our future, let’s take a look back at his 10 best works to date.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10.

It features “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">breathtaking visions of backward birds, moonwalking soldiers and un-exploding buildings,</a>” the Chicago Sun-Times notes, adding that it’s “the kind of film that reminds us of the magic of the moviegoing experience.”</p><p>Since its release was compromised by the COVID-19 pandemic, Nolan has announced that the film, which co-stars <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Pattinso</a><a href=#>n</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenneth Branagh</a>, will be re-released in theaters in “the way it was intended to be seen, on the largest IMAX and large format screens.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9.

Just experiencing these first steps out into the universe with people that you could understand and emotionally respond to,” Nolan explains.</p><p><strong>MUST READ: <a href=#>10 Matthew McConaughey Movies That Are Alright, Alright, Alright!</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. The Prestige (2006): Christopher Nolan Movies</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">There are nifty tricks galore</a> up the sumptuous sleeve of this offbeat and wildly entertaining thriller,” raved Rolling Stone of this film featuring <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugh Jackman</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">C</a><a href=#>hristian Bale</a> as two “turn-of-the-twentieth-century magicians out to beat the other at his own devious game.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scarlett Johansson</a> and Michael Caine also star, as does rocker <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">David Bowie</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;who plays inventor Nikola Tesla</a>. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">No one with any sense would say no to Christopher Nolan</a>,” Jackman told ScreenSlam about eagerly accepting the role, noting that Nolan “manages to hit the holy grail of filmmaking every time” by creating unique works that are both mentally and emotionally engaging.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7.

The Dark Knight Rises (2012): Christopher Nolan Movies</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dark Knight Rises is an ambitious, thoughtful, and potent action film</a> that concludes Christopher Nolan’s [Batman] franchise in spectacular fashion,” notes Rotten Tomatoes. Christian Bale stepped into the batsuit for his final time here, and Anne Hathaway plays Selina Kyle, aka Catwoman.</p><p>“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I’m such a director nerd.</a> I love just seeking out the best directors I can and then just watching them. Chris’ whole approach to filmmaking is one of my favorite ones,” Hathaway said during a Variety Actors on Actors series event, in which she also praised him for pushing her to do as much of her own stunt work as possible. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gary Oldman</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joseph Gordon-Levit</a><a href=#>t</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Morgan Freeman</a> and <a href=#>Marion Cotillard</a> also star.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5.

The result? “Unlike so many superheroic summer spectacles, this one actually has a soul behind the special effects,” Newsweek praised.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3.

A&nbsp;very special human being. It was one of the greatest experiences of my life.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2.

That gives audiences a lot to hang to, [and] when you get a great group of actors and incredible cast like we have, you can make this feel real and emotionally accessible.”</p><p>RELATED: <a href=#>Cillian Murphy Movies and TV Shows: From ‘Peaky Blinders’ to ‘Oppenheimer’ a Look at His Top Titles</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1.
