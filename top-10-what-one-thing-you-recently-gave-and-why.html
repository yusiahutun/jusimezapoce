I always strive for others’ approval and appreciation. I say yes to everything even if I don’t want to. Recently, I found myself prioritising others’ needs instead of mine. I felt the loss of personal identity, and the purpose of my survival was based on seeking validation. Even worse, I realised many people didn’t care about me and were just using me. Therefore, I have decided to change. I am starting to care for myself and like myself more each day. With this changed attitude, I have improved my self-worth, and I am focusing on personal growth.</span></p><p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">It is difficult to be a people pleaser all the time.

I was tired of it and realised it was time to let go. It felt like I forgot to enjoy the process in anything I did. I often pushed myself to my limits, even when the goal was beyond my reach. However, I soon realised that this longing for perfection is an illusion. It drains my energy, even when I engage in activities I enjoy. I know that if my goal is to be perfect, I will never be able to truly enjoy what I do, and that is not what I want.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Bareerah Hameed, 13, Pooi To Middle School:</span></strong><span type=text> Although I’ve been keeping records and setting New Year’s resolutions, I have found that the goals I want to achieve are too harsh and require a lot of time and management to succeed. Therefore, I get too exhausted trying, and I usually give up after a few weeks or months.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# title data-entity-uuid=c7848265-59d1-4fcb-b862-55414e8f9b2a data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>If you could run away from one responsibility, what would it be, and why?</span></strong></a></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Priscilla Leong Pui-sze, 13, Shun Tak Fraternal Association Leung Kau Kui College:</span></strong><span type=text> I always tried to make as many friends as I could so I wouldn’t feel lonely. However, as I grew older, I realised it was more beneficial to have fewer friends. When we have too many friends, it is difficult to focus on one relationship because you are constantly trying to interact with everyone. Eventually, you can’t keep up with anyone. Therefore, when it comes to friendship, quality is better than quantity.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Nazish Jabeen, 15, The Methodist Lee Wai Lee College:</span></strong><span type=text> I have decided to give up on watching Netflix. I have binge-watched most of the shows and don’t have many choices left. Moreover, some shows have repetitive storylines, which makes me less willing to watch them. After I stopped watching Netflix, I realised I became more productive. I started cooking and tutoring my siblings, which resulted in a stronger bond with my family.</span></p><p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">One reader has decided to stop binge-watching Netflix.

This was exhausting and counterproductive. It would often leave me feeling inadequate rather than motivating me to improve. Now, I have learned to focus on being the best version of myself. I have also started to appreciate the diverse skills and accomplishments of the people around me. This shift in mindset has been incredibly freeing and has allowed me to devote my energy towards my own growth and development.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Minnie Chan Wing-yi, 17, Leung Shek Chee College:</span></strong><span type=text> I have recently given up on buying useless things, which has been a great decision. As students, we constantly get money from our parents. With time, we gradually take it for granted and start mindlessly buying pretty things. Not only will our home be piled with clutter, but it will also increase our anxiety level. So, from now on, I will not buy unnecessary things.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# title data-entity-uuid=7d019de0-5eec-4ef7-b470-87061650a6b1 data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>Readers tell us the worst excuse they have ever heard</span></strong></a></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Charlotte Lau Wing-ching, 11, St Paul’s Convent School (Primary Section):</span></strong><span type=text> I recently stopped practising the piano. I’ve been learning a new piece for a few days but always make the same mistakes. The lack of progress has led to frustration and anger. I need to learn that practice makes perfect and that progress doesn’t show if you don’t put effort into something. To succeed in something, you must put in a lot of effort and trust in the process. I hope to become more patient and learn to control my frustration.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Subie Yip Kee-yi, 15, King Ling College:</span></strong><span type=text> I recently gave up on arranging a packed schedule. I used to believe I needed to utilise every minute of my life fully. I would plan a daily routine that included all my dream activities in a single day – until I soon realised that I overestimated myself. There were many times when unforeseen obstacles arose, like a complicated maths question that puzzled me. This taught me the importance of leaving some flexibility in my schedule. Now, I plan a 15-minute break after each task to incentivise me to finish on time.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Miko Yip Man-ki, 14, Po Leung Kuk Tang Yuk Tien College: I</span></strong><span type=text> stopped staying up late because I would fall asleep at school.
