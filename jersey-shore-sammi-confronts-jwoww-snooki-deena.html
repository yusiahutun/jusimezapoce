"I've been seeing interviews, people tagging things, I'm like, 'These girls definitely have beef with me.'"</h2><p>After <a href=#><strong>Samantha "Sammi Sweetheart" Giancola</strong></a> tip-toed back onto <a href=#><strong>Jersey Shore Family Vacation</strong></a> last week, she dove headfirst into the deep end tonight -- confronting three of her former costars within minutes of reuniting with them during a group vacation.</p><p>In case you missed it, <a href=#><strong>Angelina Pivarnick</strong></a> reached out to Sammi <a href=#><strong>about joining the trip</strong></a>, thinking if she recruited Giancola she'd have some additional backup in her own personal war with costars <a href=#><strong>Jenni "JWoww" Farley</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Deena Nicole Cortese</strong></a>.</p><p>Though Sam was initially hesitant to return, she said she's "healed from past-trauma" -- referring to her relationship with <a href=#><strong>Ronnie Ortiz-Magro</strong></a> -- and hoped she could get some kind of closure with her former roommates after leaving the show the first time.</p><p>As Sammi and Angelina drove together to Pennsylvania -- where they planned to surprise the rest of the group with her arrival -- Giancola filled Pivarnick in on her simmering beef with the aforementioned women. Feeling "Deena did me the dirtiest," Sam said she had "unfinished business I need resolved" with all three of them and warned she "can't be fake."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:70f6d024-853e-4341-94a9-88107755fb7c data-container-ref=toofab:article:c662aa82-6dd1-48e5-8ac6-cc83b2d27838 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/cd/5by4/2023/08/03/cdb1976c458e4e8aa7c1c89df69be3b8_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">MTV/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Sammi Sweetheart Explains Her 'Bad Blood' with Costars In Jersey Shore Return</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Before the pair arrived, <a href=#><strong>Vinny Guadagnino</strong></a> joked "What time is Sammi getting here?" before both Snooki and JWoww brought up how she blocked them. "She's too good for us," remarked Jenni, before Nicole added, "She's not a woman's woman."</p><p>Moments later, Sammi strolled right into the house saying, "Sorry, I'm late." With that, every single jaw in the house dropped, with Deena and Nicole both crying upon seeing her. "If Jenni's face could move, it definitely would be super shocked right now," quipped <a href=#><strong>Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino</strong></a>, before calling the reunion one of the most "epic moments in Jersey Shore history."</p><p>It didn't take long for Sam to whip up some drama, however, as moments later she blurted out: "We have a lot to talk about.

"You know why," Sam shot back, before explaining she felt "hurt" when Snooki decided to open up a store in Seaside Heights after Sammi had done the same.</p><p>"You were offended I opened up a store in Seaside?" asked Nicole, before Sam said she specifically took issue with it being being a "beach boutique" or beach-themed, like her own shop. She felt the Seaside location in particular wasn't on brand with Nicole's other stores, before adding, "I don't want to ruin your business, I don't want you to affect my business. When I found out I was like, 'Whoa, I didn't want that taken from me.'"</p><p>"They're fighting over who sells seashells by the seashore, literally!" cracked Vinny in a confessional, calling it a "first-world problem."</p><p>After Nicole explained the Seaside location had the same inventory and branding as the rest of her stores, but did sell some beach things "because it's on the beach," Sammi apologized for being "petty." With that, Nicole started to cry, though the pair quickly made up, clinked glasses and agreed to move on.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:dae538f1-432a-4e43-8371-bd06c2efe9b6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:c662aa82-6dd1-48e5-8ac6-cc83b2d27838 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ed/5by4/2023/08/03/edc11e0ace1044db941c8a6f0ddd8be4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">MTV</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Ronnie Breaks Down In Jersey Shore Return as He Plans to 'Ask My Roommates for Forgiveness'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Sammi then shifted her sights to Deena, who didn't think anyone had beef with Giancola, let alone herself.</p><p>Sammi went on to claim Deena ghosted her after she quit the show, something which hurt because she believed they had a real friendship. Cortese explained that she's terrible at texting, before saying that sometimes life just gets in the way and people drift apart without it being malicious.</p><p>"I loved our friendship too.

I watch your interviews and you're like, 'Can we just not talk about her?' And that was hurtful, I was like, 'Why would she do that?'" said Sam. "Why are you being messy coming for me now? I don't say one thing about you, never."</p><p>Sammi was referring to <a href=#><strong>an interview JWoww did with Barstool</strong></a>, in which Jen appeared confused as to why Sam was suddenly interacting with Jersey Shore content on social media after supposedly wanting "nothing to do with the show" since she quit the first time around.</p><p>"I have always loved Sammi. The problem I was having is she wanted nothing to do with the show, but we're the show, so to me I felt like Sammi had a problem with us," Jen explained of her frustration in a confessional.</p><p>Sammi, however, said her decision to not return to the show had nothing to do with them -- adding she just "couldn't be in a house with a toxic ex," again referring to Ron.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8f37523a-e932-4e11-958c-ff2562c8ae7b data-container-ref=toofab:article:c662aa82-6dd1-48e5-8ac6-cc83b2d27838 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/9a/5by4/2023/08/01/9a42070ed6104b2989bb424b346bac16_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">MTV</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Sammi 'Sweetheart' Giancola On Seeing Ronnie Ortiz-Magro After 11 Years In Her Jersey Shore Return</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"You guys maybe didn't even know, but nobody's ever really asked me either," she told them. "It wasn't I hated 'Jersey Shore,' it was kind of like I had to get my s--t together and figure out my life. Especially when I just got out of it."</p><p>Jenni then apologized, adding that she genuinely loves Sam before they also made up.</p><p>After watching this parade of resolutions go down in front of her face, Angelina was seething. Wondering why it was so easy for Sam to resolve all her conflicts in record time, while she always feels like she's in the dog house with the entire cast, she asked, "She's only been here for 12 minutes and she's already made up with everybody?"</p><p>Not quite. There's still the Ronnie of it all -- though it remains to be seen whether the pair will actually cross paths when he pops up on their trip later this season.</p><p>Jersey Shore Family Vacation airs Thursdays on MTV.</p><a id=gallery-link-39767cfc-9c85-41be-8ad5-cbfc6fd05efa class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:39767cfc-9c85-41be-8ad5-cbfc6fd05efa data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:c662aa82-6dd1-48e5-8ac6-cc83b2d27838 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3f/4by3/2023/08/03/3f03a652b4d8415696d4226b2056eec8_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fmamhfn7Kzv8SyZKygn6eybr%2FApqSiZZOku6e%2BzqerrGWarLy4w4yspainm556pbHEp5ho</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjersey-shore-sammi-confronts-jwoww-snooki-deena.html&text=Sammi%20Confronts%20JWoww%2c%20Snooki%20and%20Deena%20Over%20Unresolved%20Beef%20In%20Jersey%20Shore%20Return&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjersey-shore-sammi-confronts-jwoww-snooki-deena.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjersey-shore-sammi-confronts-jwoww-snooki-deena.html&title=Sammi%20Confronts%20JWoww%2c%20Snooki%20and%20Deena%20Over%20Unresolved%20Beef%20In%20Jersey%20Shore%20Return" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjersey-shore-sammi-confronts-jwoww-snooki-deena.html&title=Sammi%20Confronts%20JWoww%2c%20Snooki%20and%20Deena%20Over%20Unresolved%20Beef%20In%20Jersey%20Shore%20Return" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjersey-shore-sammi-confronts-jwoww-snooki-deena.html&title=Sammi%20Confronts%20JWoww%2c%20Snooki%20and%20Deena%20Over%20Unresolved%20Beef%20In%20Jersey%20Shore%20Return" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjersey-shore-sammi-confronts-jwoww-snooki-deena.html&description=Sammi%20Confronts%20JWoww%2c%20Snooki%20and%20Deena%20Over%20Unresolved%20Beef%20In%20Jersey%20Shore%20Return" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./phil-laak.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Phil Laak dating?
