Aaron and Sam Taylor-Johnson are famous for how well they’ve done in their respective careers and their age gap.&nbsp;</p><p>Aaron Taylor-Johnson is a famous actor who has appeared in several blockbusters, including “Kick-Ass,” “Savages,” and “Avengers: Age of Ultron.” Sam Taylor-Johnson is a filmmaker and photographer.&nbsp;</p><p>Some movies she has directed include “Nowhere Boy,” and “Fifty Shades of Grey.” Wylda is the first child Aaron and Sam welcomed together as a couple.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aaronn-1.jpg><p>They have one more daughter, Romy Hero Johnson. They also raise Angelica Jopling and Jessie Phoenix Jopling, Sam’s children from her first marriage to art dealer Jay Jopling.&nbsp;</p><p>Wylda Rae Johnson was <a href=#>born</a> on July 7, 2010, in London. Her father was 20 years old when she was born, while Sam was 43 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>Becoming a parent at such a young age is not an easy task since there is still a lot of growing up to do as an individual. However, Aaron seems to have been born with an all-you-need-to-know manual because he excels at it.&nbsp;</p><p>Aaron is a great father and enjoys reading to Wylda. The proud dad and his wife, who is 23 years older than him, are huge on privacy where their daughter is concerned.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aaron.jpg><p>Some believe this has to do with some people’s negative reviews about their relationships. Wylda rarely attends events with her parents, and they hardly publicly talk about her or her sister.&nbsp;</p><p>The same thing goes for social media. Sam and Aaron avoid sharing pictures of their kids; on the rare occasions they post about them, their faces never show in the photos.&nbsp;For instance, in 2020, Wylda broke her arm, and Sam shared the news on her <a href=#>Instagram</a> page. Wylda’s face was hidden in the post, but her injured arm was evident.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Wylda_Rae_Johnsons_Siblings></span>Wylda Rae Johnson’s Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wylda has three siblings; her sister Romy and her two half-sisters, Angelica and Jessie. The pair were born while Sam was with Jopling.&nbsp;Wylda’s oldest sister Angelica was born on April 24, 1997. The next most senior is Jessie, who was born in November 2005. The youngest is Romy, who was born on January 18, 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>Like her biological father, Wylda’s older sister, Angelica, grew up loving art. She is now the founding director of an exhibition program called “Incubator.”&nbsp;Aaron raised all four girls with love even though he became a parent at a young age (he is seven years older than Angelica).&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Details_on_Sam_and_Aarons_Romance></span>Details on Sam and Aaron’s Romance<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sam and Aaron have been married for over ten years. They met in 2008 when Aaron auditioned for the lead role in Sam’s debut project as a director, “Nowhere Boy.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/family.jpg><p>One thing led to another, and they started dating when Aaron was 19. Aaron asked the big question one year after that meeting, and Sam said yes. Their relationship made many headlines in its infancy because of their age gap.&nbsp;</p><p>Sam took a lot of heat because of the age gap, but the director could care less. Speaking about how their union works, she once <a href=#>said</a>:&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t really analyze our relationship. I just know that it works.”</p><p>She also added: “I just feel secure and loved and safe. We have this profound connection. We’re just in sync.”</p><p>Sam and Aaron took their time before they tied the knot. Aaron settled in as a father to her two kids and became a biological dad after Wylda and Romy came along.&nbsp;</p><p>The famous actor and Sam eventually <a href=#>married</a> two years after their two biological children were born. The date was June 21, 2012, and it bound the two for what is now looking like forever.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Couple_Renewed_Their_Vows></span>The Couple Renewed Their Vows<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite the backlash they have gotten, age has been and will forever remain just a number to the couple. They renewed their vows in June 2022. The actor posted about it on his Instagram page.</p><p>He shared a lovely picture of him and Sam. He <a href=#>captioned</a> it:&nbsp;“Yesterday was the most beautiful day, summer solstice, our 10th anniversary… we renewed our vows to one another and confessed our love in front of our nearest and dearest friends and family; it was a celebration of love and joy!”</p><p>Sam and Aaron are not the only celebrity couple with a decades-long age gap between them. Others include <a href=#>Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher</a>, George and Amal Clooney, and Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02ausqSUlnqzrcRmoaignqi8r3nIrGSamaKku26tzZ1krJmdYsGixcuoqWain527tLvNrGSdmaWctbWx0Wg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeet-wylda-rae-johnson-is-aaron-and-sam-taylor-johnsons-daughter.html&text=Meet%20Wylda%20Rae%20Johnson%2c%20Aaron%20and%20Sam%20Taylor-Johnson%27s%20Daughter&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-wylda-rae-johnson-is-aaron-and-sam-taylor-johnsons-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-wylda-rae-johnson-is-aaron-and-sam-taylor-johnsons-daughter.html&title=Meet%20Wylda%20Rae%20Johnson%2c%20Aaron%20and%20Sam%20Taylor-Johnson%27s%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeet-wylda-rae-johnson-is-aaron-and-sam-taylor-johnsons-daughter.html&title=Meet%20Wylda%20Rae%20Johnson%2c%20Aaron%20and%20Sam%20Taylor-Johnson%27s%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-wylda-rae-johnson-is-aaron-and-sam-taylor-johnsons-daughter.html&title=Meet%20Wylda%20Rae%20Johnson%2c%20Aaron%20and%20Sam%20Taylor-Johnson%27s%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-wylda-rae-johnson-is-aaron-and-sam-taylor-johnsons-daughter.html&description=Meet%20Wylda%20Rae%20Johnson%2c%20Aaron%20and%20Sam%20Taylor-Johnson%27s%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./19-surprising-facts-about-royal-albert-hall.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="19 Surprising Facts About Royal Albert Hall">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kathie-lee-gifford-posts-adorable-photo-of-grandson-frankie.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kathie Lee Gifford Posts Adorable New Photo of Grandson Frankie: Completely in Love">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
