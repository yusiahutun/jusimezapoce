The chocolate pretzel cookies I made were shiny, twisted and gorgeous, but tasted so mediocre — dry, flat in flavor, basically meh. I concluded that the firmness we’d want from a pretzel-shape was probably not something we wanted in a cookie. But silly me, I was just looking in the wrong place.<p><span id=more-11188></span></p><p><a title="vanilla, white and rye flours, sugar, salt, hard-cooked egg" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5538/11309318983_1ee4439ba2_z.jpg alt="vanilla, white and rye flours, sugar, salt, hard-cooked egg" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Last fall, as some of you might remember, I did a little tiny bit of <a href=#>book-touring</a> from November through mid-December and then February through March of this year, just like 28 cities or so in total of us hanging out, no big deal. Okay, it was <i>kind</i> of a big deal, and so many cool things happened over the course of those trips, I never got around to telling you about them maybe because the whole thing was so surreal to me it didn’t seem easily digested in 500-word snippets?</p><p><a title="cook's illustrated" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3784/11310020454_e8aeda6379_z.jpg alt="cook's illustrated" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Nevertheless, I really owe you a story about the day I was in Boston and was invited to visit the <a href=#>America’s Test Kitchen</a>/<a href=#>Cook’s Illustrated</a> offices and kitchens, which are exactly as awesome as you’d imagine them, and yet cozier. The whole place feels like a giant house on different floors and people are incredibly friendly and warm. Did you know that CI has the largest privately owned cookbook collection in the world? Just 4,000 or so — who wants to move in there with me? The kitchens are amazing as you’d expect, busy with clusters of cooks testing out different recipes. When a recipe needs to be tested, a call is placed over the speaker that pipes through the offices and people are encouraged to stop what they’re doing and take part in blind tastings, because obviously this is the best place to work in the whole world. While I was there, we were encouraged to try steamed fish, and I really was about to, I was, but then over in the corner, I spied someone testing <a href=#>picnic fried chicken</a> and the next thing I knew, I was maybe-possibly begging for my own personal unscheduled tasting and no doubt ensuring that I’ll never be invited back again. It was totally worth it. That stuff was amazing, and while the cook was emphatic in telling me they were just getting started with the testing, that it wasn’t ready yet, I snuck another piece. I’m not sorry.</p><p><a title="hard-boiled egg, yolk popped out" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3819/11309320093_26e91bd2a8_z.jpg alt="hard-boiled egg, yolk popped out" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="egg yolk, pressed through a strainer" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3801/11309241196_9c54257e66_z.jpg alt="egg yolk, pressed through a strainer" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="crumbly dough to knead together" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3811/11309199455_bd270abbd2_z.jpg alt="crumbly dough to knead together" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a title="slice of 1/4-inch, roll into ball to soften" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7326/11309200145_985a7267d3_n.jpg alt="slice of 1/4-inch, roll into ball to soften" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="roll into 6-inch rope" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5499/11309244526_158d7ab48b_n.jpg alt="roll into 6-inch rope" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="twist down one end" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7367/11309324813_d7786f2207_n.jpg alt="twist down one end" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="and then the other. voila: pretzel!" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3689/11309203055_20e4500484_n.jpg alt="and then the other. voila: pretzel!" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>What does this have to do with pretzels? Having witnessed even a particle-sized segment of how serious they take their recipe testing, it should be no surprise that the way to figure out how to make pretzel-shaped cookies that actually taste excellent was to turn to CI. The recipe is from an old article about perfecting the French butter cookie known as a sable. They found that two things helped them nail the hallmark sandiness of the cookie, dialing back the butter a bit, and using an egg yolk that had already been hard-cookied. I went one step further in tweaking this; I have an ongoing fixation with Swedish rye cookies and couldn’t resist replacing one-third of the flour with rye flour. The resulting cookie looks straight out of one of those Danish butter cookie tins, you know, if they were made with whole-grain flours and real vanilla, and they’re really fun to make with a <a href=#>truck-aproned assistant</a>.</p><p><a title="pretzel cookies, ready to bake" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7295/11309327583_78a33a26e7_z.jpg alt="pretzel cookies, ready to bake" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="sugared pretzel cookies, cooling" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5472/11309276864_eed8625dc0_z.jpg alt="sugared pretzel cookies, cooling" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="sugared rye pretzel cookies" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5477/11309331833_0c3a72285c_z.jpg alt="sugared rye pretzel cookies" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="sugared pretzel cookies" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3738/11309257666_4843d6b72a_z.jpg alt="sugared pretzel cookies" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>Cookie Week!</strong> This week is all about the cookies.

You can use an equal amount of all-purpose flour (1/2 cup) if you don’t wish to make these with rye flour.</p><p>Yield: 80, eh, in hindsight, I think this estimate from CI is too high (and commenters agree), I’d say 48 tops and 36 safely. Apologies for any trouble.</p><p>1 large egg, hard-boiled and cooled<br>10 tablespoons (140 grams or 1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter, softened<br>1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon (80 grams) granulated sugar<br>1/4 teaspoon table salt<br>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract (this is halved from the original)<br>1 cup (125 grams) unbleached all-purpose flour<br>1/2 cup (45 grams) rye flour (medium or white will work)<br>1 large egg white, lightly beaten with 1 teaspoon water<br>4 teaspoons turbinado or clear sanding sugar</p><p>Place butter, sugar and salt in the bowl of stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment. Crack egg and peel shell. Separate yolk from white; add white to your next sandwich or egg salad. Press yolk through fine-mesh strainer and into mixer bowl with other ingredients. Beat mixture on medium speed until light and fluffy, scraping down sides of bowl and beater with spatula as needed. Add vanilla, mix until combined. Add flours and mix at low speed until just combined. Using rubber spatula or your hands, reach into bowl and knead dough a few times into a cohesive mass.</p><p>Divide dough in half; place each half on a square of parchment paper. Form each into a log about 6 inches long (it will be about 1 3/4 inches in diameter) and wrap tightly with parchment, twisting ends to seal. Chill logs for 30 minutes, until semi-firm. (If you chill them longer, you’ll want to warm them up a bit or it’s difficult to work them into pretzel shapes.)</p><p>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</p><p>Slice 1/4-inch off first chilled log and roll slice into a ball in the palm of your hands; this softens the dough. On a counter, roll ball into a 6-inch rope. Pick up each end of rope and fold turn it into the center, pressing it into a pretzel shape. Transfer to baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, placing cookies one inch apart on prepared sheets.</p><p>Brush each pretzel cookie with egg white wash, then sprinkle with coarse sugar. Bake cookies until they have golden brown edges, about 13 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven but let firm up on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring cookies to cooling racks.</p><p>Do ahead: Cookies stored in an airtight container between sheets of waxed or parchment paper will keep for at least one week.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-11188 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-11188 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
