In August, they were said to be “getting to know each other with good feelings”, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Korean reports</a>. The couple’s respective agencies acknowledged the relationship and asked the public for their support and understanding.</p><p>This announcement was unusual because K-pop stars rarely reveal much about their private lives. In fact, in years past, it was not unusual for agencies to ban new stars from dating or even having a cell phone. Any admission of a romantic relationship or a partner was considered scandalous. Sociologist Patrick Williams of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>told the BBC</a> that romantic relationships can be considered “bad for business” in the world of K-pop. “They want to sell idols that appear to be, at least in an imaginary sense, romantically obtainable. Fans can imagine themselves in some form of social relationship with this idol,” Dr Williams said.</p><p>In a 2016 interview, Jisoo explained how strict YG Entertainment and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Yang Hyun-Suk were about dating</a>. “The first time I met Yang-Hyun Suk, he asked me, ‘Do you happen to have a boyfriend right now?’ At the time, I was wearing a ring, and he even asked what that ring was,” she said. “I didn’t have a boyfriend, and It was just a ring.” Jisoo even explained that YG schedules its trainees to eat at different times so male and female trainees don’t spend too much time together. “Even the eating times of trainees are different. At YG’s cafeteria, if the boys eat at 6 o’clock, the girls will eat at 7 o’clock,” she said on a 2017 episode of&nbsp;Radio Star.</p><p>Prior to Jisoo, Jennie was the only member of BLACKPINK to have a confirmed relationship while in the band. The rapper and singer dated EXO’s Kai from October 2018 to January 2019. SM Entertainment, EXO’s management company, confirmed the couple’s relationship in December 2018 after the two were&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>photographed on a date</a>&nbsp;together. (Fans started to speculate about their relationship in October 2018 after Kai and Jennie both posted romantic photos in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris around the same time.)</p><p>However, by January 2019, the romance was over. SM Entertainment confirmed toward the end of the month that the two were no longer dating. “It is true that Kai and Jennie have recently parted ways,” the company said in a statement. As for why they broke up, a source told Naver at the time that the two&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>split because of their schedules</a>. The insider claimed that Kai and Jennie wanted to focus on their careers but they ended their relationship as friends.</p><p>In February 2021, Dispatch, a South Korean media outlet, reported that Jennie and BIGBANG’s G-Dragon had been dating for a year. The two previously collaborated on his 2013 song “BLACK.” According to Dispatch, G-Dragon had a personal parking lot and a private elevator at his penthouse, which Jennie would use to visit him in secret. The outlet reported that Jennie would often go to G-Dragon’s house after her daily schedule for BLACKPINK. According to Dispatch, YG Entertainment knew of Jennie and G-Dragon’s relationship.</p><p>The outlet also reported that Jennie’s manager, as well as G-Dragon’s manager, would often drive her to and from his house. Dispatch first saw Jennie leaving G-Dragon’s house on January 31, 2021, the day of BLACKPINK’s online concert, “The Show.” The outlet reported that they saw Jennie leaving G-Dragon’s house that morning to head to the concert venue. G-Dragon’s car was also seen at the venue, according to Dispatch. “Quite a lot of people at YG have noticed their relationship,” a source told Dispatch. “Jennie’s mother is also aware of her relationship with G-Dragon. She’s thankful that he takes special care of her.”</p><p>In response to the rumors, YG Entertainment released this statement: “We can not confirm anything about our artists’ personal lives. We ask for your understanding.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfn7a0u85mmKGmXZe8brTYrqVmmqKarqx51Klm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjisoo-ahn-bo-hyun-break-up.html&text=Why%20Did%20Jisoo%2c%20Ahn%20Bo%20Hyun%20Break%20Up%3f%20Blackpink%20Member%20Split&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjisoo-ahn-bo-hyun-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjisoo-ahn-bo-hyun-break-up.html&title=Why%20Did%20Jisoo%2c%20Ahn%20Bo%20Hyun%20Break%20Up%3f%20Blackpink%20Member%20Split" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjisoo-ahn-bo-hyun-break-up.html&title=Why%20Did%20Jisoo%2c%20Ahn%20Bo%20Hyun%20Break%20Up%3f%20Blackpink%20Member%20Split" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjisoo-ahn-bo-hyun-break-up.html&title=Why%20Did%20Jisoo%2c%20Ahn%20Bo%20Hyun%20Break%20Up%3f%20Blackpink%20Member%20Split" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjisoo-ahn-bo-hyun-break-up.html&description=Why%20Did%20Jisoo%2c%20Ahn%20Bo%20Hyun%20Break%20Up%3f%20Blackpink%20Member%20Split" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=next><a href=./sharon-case.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Sharon Case dating?
