After completing high school, he joined college briefly in Madison, Wisconsin. However, Jeremy dropped out of school to pursue a true sense of adventure and ended up in Alaska. After setting roots in Alaska, he dedicated most of his time to running dogs.</p><p class=align-left>Most of his early 1990s were spent assisting with dog teams. After gaining enough skills and experience, in 2007, he became a full-time musher. However, the financial commitment needed to partake in Iditarod races caused Jeremy to put his dreams aside. Luckily, he got an opportunity to become a cast member of <i>Edge of Alaska</i>.</p><p class=align-left>In the <i>Edge of Alaska </i>show which aired on the Discovery Channel, Keller showcases his daily activities and works to keep the small town from gaining unnecessary attention or attracting visitors and <a href=#>tourists</a>. Keller is often seen on the show being on opposite sides with Neil Darish, another cast member who wants to modernize the town and boost its tourist appeal.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/51b104711cbee199.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ivy Calvin from "Storage Wars": net worth, Grandma's Attic, married, eyes</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/63a99ed75b32af00.jpg><h3>Jeremy Keller Iditarod racing statistics</h3><p class=align-left>Since the<i> Edge of Alaska </i>ended, what is Jeremy Keller doing now? Keller is an <a href=# title="Jeremy Keller" rel="nofollow noopener">Iditarod dogsled musher </a>who has participated in the race three times. He joined the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in Alaska in 2007, where he ran for 15 days and 15 hours. For this competition, he was ranked position 54 and won $1,049. His second race was in 2019, where he ran for 13 days and 22 hours.</p><p class=align-left>For the second race, he was position 37 and won $1,049. Keller’s third race was in 2020, where he ran part of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race but decided to drop out. The Iditarod race is not an easy one. It requires the musher and the dogs to cover around 1,000 miles involving treacherous climbs in sub-zero temperatures, and much of it occurs in darkness and blinding winds.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c5dbb48e101cd300.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jace Norman bio: Net worth, wife, height, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><h3>Jeremy Keller’s wife</h3><p class=align-left>Jeremy’s wife is Alison, whom she met while living in McCarthy, Alaska. The couple, who have been married for over 15 years, are homesteaders who prefer the serene outdoor nature compared to the bustle of city life. <a href=# title="Jeremy Keller" rel="nofollow noopener">Jeremy and Alison </a>met in Alaska, went on their first date in 2002, which involved a dog sled ride.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/51b104711cbee199.jpg><p class=align-left>The lovebirds married the following year, and 18 months later, Alison gave birth to their firstborn. Alison is a blogger who uses the platform to inform the world about the struggles that the residents of McCarthy face and the day-to-day activities that help them survive and live a self-sufficient life. The blog also focuses on how the <a href=#>family</a> lives life in isolation and on edge.</p><p class=align-left>Alison is often a guest writer on her husband’s website called <i><a href=# title="Jeremy Keller" rel="nofollow noopener">All Roads Lead to Dogs</a>,</i> where she updates readers on Jeremy’s progress in Iditarod races. When she is not blogging, Alison is studying and practising energy medicine and taking care of her family and their dogs.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1329ac1653e0a078.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Taylor Sheridan: wife, net worth, TV shows, production company</span></p></a><h3>Family</h3><p class=align-left>Is Jeremy still in McCarthy, Alaska? No. After living in McCarthy for over two decades, Jeremy moved to a town called Knik. He lives with his wife and two sons: Bjorn and Liam. Both sons are involved in creating a great Iditarod dog team and racing them across <a href=# title="Jeremy Keller">Alaska</a>. Bjorn, the eldest son, has followed in his father’s footsteps as he participated in the Junior Iditarod race in 2020.</p><h3>What is Jeremy Keller net worth?</h3><p class=align-left>Jeremy Keller is one of the few people who are millionaires and still live a self-sufficient life. His net worth is allegedly<a href=# title="Jeremy Keller" rel="nofollow noopener"> $12 million</a>. But that is not surprising considering he was one of the cast members in <i>Edge of Alaska</i> who put a spotlight on the small town in Alaska called McCarthy and showed the day-to-day activities of its residents.</p><h3>How did Jeremy Keller make his money?</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e170222373123f8d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tony Hinchcliffe: Wife, gay, net worth, family, stand up comedy</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A big portion of Jeremy’s impressive earnings comes from his role as the cast member of the <i>Edge of Alaska</i>. Since the <a href=#>television series </a>aired from 2014 to 2017, Keller must have pocketed a good salary per episode. He also earns a living training and developing sled dogs and participating in the Iditarod races.</p><h3>Accident</h3><p class=align-left>The veteran Iditarod musher has not escaped injuries while living off the grid. While walking across a damp footbridge, Jeremy slipped on the wet board, crashed on the riverbank, and broke his leg. To fix the injury, he underwent major surgery, and steel rods were inserted from the knee to ankle. The recovery was long and not easy. But the leg healed, and Jeremy was able to take part in the 2007 Iditarod race.</p><p class=align-left>Jeremy Keller has made a name for himself in the television documentary <i>Edge of Alaska</i> and as a professional dog musher. He has also used his experience and knowledge to train sled dogs. By participating in the Iditarod races three times, Jeremy continues to show the <a href=#>world</a> that three is more to his life than creating a self-sustaining homestead.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0bf4342c17f2a948.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How did Flip from Street Outlaws die?
