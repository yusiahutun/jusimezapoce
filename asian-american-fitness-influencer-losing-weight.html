She writes about how she feels, and what the day brought. The idea, she says, is to get people to follow along, as much or as little as they are able.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But a lot of Ho’s followers aren’t having it. Fans who subscribed to her peppy, self-accepting doctrine suddenly saw her as a traitor, someone who wanted to look like every other taut and toned fitness influencer out there.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m heartbroken you feel like you want to do this to yourself,” said one fan. Another wrote: “Setting an arbitrary number as a ‘goal’ seems to fly in the face of all the great and meaningful self-love that you’ve been teaching us.” More people chimed in about how Ho was now “demonising larger bodies” and “idolising” thin ones.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My content is not even offensive, but people were finding ways to make me feel like I’m doing something wrong,” Ho says. “I wanted to go on this journey to get really fit. It’s crazy, but people have a problem with it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Midway through her challenge, Ho came to terms with her haters. She now proceeds unencumbered, charting her progress on her website blogilates.com and her social media channels.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">The really amazing thing is that now, girls all over the world use my YouTube videos to discover fitness in their own bedroomsCassey Ho</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ho has a lot of experience silencing naysayers and pushing on – this despite not becoming familiar with the concept of fitness until she was 16.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ho was born in Woodland Hills, a neighbourhood in Los Angeles, to Vietnamese immigrants.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My mother escaped from Vietnam on a boat, getting first to Malaysia then Canada and finally the US. She was on that boat for a week without food or water. Both my parents left Vietnam midway through college. They had to stop and start over and learn a new language.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/08/60f8a4ba-e8d2-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_972x_091936.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When she was five, her father accepted a tech job in the San Francisco Bay Area and the family relocated. Her father was also a tennis coach, and pushed his daughters into the sport. Ho hated it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He trained us really hard. He was an Asian father in that kind of way. I just had to get used to being yelled at on the court by my dad.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How yoga helped two people overcome addiction, depression</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It didn’t help that she was considered a chubby kid, although she never saw herself that way until she was six, and a boy at school pointed at her and called her fat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I ran into the bathroom and cried,” she says. “My whole image of my body changed at that point.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/08/4f9ae20a-e8d2-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_972x_091936.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When she was 16, Ho came across an infomercial from Pilates guru Mari Winsor, and begged her father to get her the DVD set.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That is the woman who helped me discover fitness,” says Ho, who practised the deliberate moves in her bedroom. “I never even thought of fitness as a thing. There was only tennis and I didn’t like it and that was that. Pilates was something I could do just for me – not for my team or a coach or a dad or to beat anyone.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/08/b6934146-e8d2-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_972x_091936.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She went on to university to study biology and business, and kept the Pilates going in her dorm room, attracting the attention of fellow students who wanted to learn. She devised a system called Pop Pilates – Pilates moves to pop music – which she has since trademarked.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She got her teaching certification and started teaching in local gyms. Moving to Boston after she graduated, she got a job in the fashion business, but began putting her Pilates-to-music videos on YouTube so she wouldn’t lose touch with her students in LA. She was stunned by how quickly her following grew.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When she realised she couldn’t find a yoga bag that could hold everything she needed, she designed one, got some media exposure and quit her job.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/08/61a8eb9a-e8d2-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_972x_091936.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I decided to go for it 100 per cent,” she says. “I went to [China’s Canton trade fair in] Guangzhou, found a manufacturer for the bags, but when I came back to Boston realised I had no way to pay the rent.” She taught 12 Pilates classes a week and then moved back to Los Angeles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She now sells athletic wear, planners and yoga mats under her brand Pop Flex. Her Pop Pilates classes are taught by instructors in 8,000 locations around the US. And her constantly updated fitness videos on YouTube have been seen by more than 500 million people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/08/b5d184fc-e8d2-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_972x_091936.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Still, despite her celebrity, Ho says it’s the small things that are the most meaningful to her.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The really amazing thing is that now, girls all over the world use my YouTube videos to discover fitness in their own bedrooms,” she says. “Just the way that I did years ago.”</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Love me slender: going on diet brings out haters</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2avlaG5r7HSrGaaqqSesK2xjmxnbGloaYNwrdKimKdlkaKys7XCmqVmnpmpu6a%2F0magp56cqrKvr8SrZKWno567qHnWnqCgoKQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fasian-american-fitness-influencer-losing-weight.html&text=Asian-American%20fitness%20influencer%20Cassey%20Ho%20on%20losing%20weight%2c%20overcoming%20haters%20and%20being%20true%20to%20he&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fasian-american-fitness-influencer-losing-weight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fasian-american-fitness-influencer-losing-weight.html&title=Asian-American%20fitness%20influencer%20Cassey%20Ho%20on%20losing%20weight%2c%20overcoming%20haters%20and%20being%20true%20to%20he" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fasian-american-fitness-influencer-losing-weight.html&title=Asian-American%20fitness%20influencer%20Cassey%20Ho%20on%20losing%20weight%2c%20overcoming%20haters%20and%20being%20true%20to%20he" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fasian-american-fitness-influencer-losing-weight.html&title=Asian-American%20fitness%20influencer%20Cassey%20Ho%20on%20losing%20weight%2c%20overcoming%20haters%20and%20being%20true%20to%20he" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fasian-american-fitness-influencer-losing-weight.html&description=Asian-American%20fitness%20influencer%20Cassey%20Ho%20on%20losing%20weight%2c%20overcoming%20haters%20and%20being%20true%20to%20he" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./christina-padilla-sleep-deprived-new-mom-killed-nanny-injured-toddler-ran-red-light-day-giving-birth-sentenced-just-48-hours-jail-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christina Padilla: Sleep-deprived new mom who killed nanny and injured toddler when she ran a red li">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./apps-identify-song.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5 Apps to Identify a Song by Humming, Tapping on Keyboard, or Asking Others">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
