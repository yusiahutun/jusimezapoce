Sources said it’s thrown their family into “chaos”.</p><p>“Justin owns who he was when he and Britney were together, even though his personality, career, lifestyle, and personal priorities are radically different now, 20 years later,” one insider told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Sun</a>. “This book is a nightmare for him because of how it throws the whole family into chaos. The timing stings just as much as the revelation itself.”</p><p>The insider continued: “Justin had a big fall planned with new music on deck, more work with his old friends in *NSYNC, and of course, the next installment of the Trolls franchise, which has been a huge moneymaker for Justin over the last several years.”</p><p>Another insider quoted by <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Mirror</a> said: “I have no idea if the abortion was something he ever told Jessica about because Justin’s relationship with Britney is not something he discusses with his friends. He’s not in denial about it, but to him, this was a million years ago.”</p><p>They continued: “Justin owns who he was when he and Britney were together, even though his personality, career, lifestyle, and personal priorities are radically different now, 20 years later. This book is a nightmare for him because of how it throws the whole family into chaos. The timing stings just as much as the revelation itself.”</p><p>However, a source <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told ET</a> that Justin “is happy at home with&nbsp;Jessica Biel&nbsp;and his kids,” adding that Timberlake “is focusing on new music and is in such a great place.”&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s how Britney described the moment in time in her memoir. “I loved Justin so much. I always expected us to have a family together one day. This would just be much earlier than I’d anticipated,” she wrote. “But Justin definitely wasn’t happy about the pregnancy. He said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young.”</p><p>The pop icon admitted that she “agreed not to have the baby” but seemed to have some regrets about the decision they made more than 20 years ago. “I don’t know if that was the right decision. If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it,” she revealed. “And yet Justin was so sure that he didn’t want to be a father.”</p><p>She also revealed how they shared their first kiss. Alongside Justin, Britney joined The All-New Mickey Mouse Club when she was 11 years old in 1992. She described it as “honestly a kid’s dream — unbelievably fun, particularly for a kid like me. But it was also exceptionally hard work: we would run choreography thirty times in a day, trying to get every step perfect.” She shared a dressing room with Christina Aguilera and looked up to the older cast members like Keri Russell, Ryan Gosling, and Ryan Lucca.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/justin-timberlake-britney-spears.png><p>Though she disclosed that behind the scenes, there was a start of her relationship with co-star Justin Timberlake. “[Once] at a sleepover, we played Truth or Dare, and someone dared Justin to kiss me. A Janet Jackson song was playing in the background as he leaned in and kissed me.”</p><p>It’s not the first time Justin and Jessica’s marriage has faced challenges with several cheating scandals over the years. Us Weekly claimed in October 2010 that&nbsp;<a href=#>Justin cheated on Jessica with Olivia Munn</a>&nbsp;long before his PDA photos with his&nbsp;Palmer&nbsp;costar&nbsp;<a href=#>Alisha Wainwright</a>.</p><p>A source told Us Weekly at the time that the former NSYNC member and the&nbsp;X-Men: Apocalypse&nbsp;star had a t<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hree-day rendezvous in September 2010</a>&nbsp;after meeting at a MySpace event. “[He] started chasing her immediately,” the insider said. According to Us Weekly, Munn told Timberlake that they couldn’t have a fling if he was still with Biel, which led the “Suit and Tie” singer to tell her that he and the&nbsp;7th Heaven&nbsp;alum were broken up.</p><p>“[He] has been telling people it’s over with Jessica, even though the reality is he’s just doing it behind her back,” the source said at the time. The insider even went on to say that Timberlake and Munn were “openly affectionate” and “had amazing sex” after the&nbsp;Office Christmas Party&nbsp;actress invited the “Can’t Stop the Feeling” crooner to her hotel in New York City in late September 2010.</p><p>The former NSYNC member took to his Instagram on Thursday, December 4 2019, to break his silence on the affair rumors, which started in late November after he and Wainright, his&nbsp;Palmer&nbsp;costar, were photographed holding hands in New Orleans.</p><p>“I stay away from gossip as much as I can, but for my family I feel it is important to address recent rumors that are hurting the people I love,” he wrote. “A few weeks ago I displayed a strong lapse in judgement – but let me be clear – nothing happened between me and my costar.”</p><p>Timberlake blamed his behavior on his drinking and apologized to Biel and their 4-year-old son Silas for the “embarrassment” that he had put them through. “I drank way too much that night and I regret my behavior. I should have known better,” he wrote. “This is not the example I want to set for my son. I apologize to my amazing wife and family for putting them through such an embarrassing situation, and I am focused on being the best husband and father I can be. This was not that.”</p><p>He continued, “I am incredibly proud to be working on Palmer. Looking forward to continuing to make this movie and excited for people to see it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/britney-spears-the-woman-in-me.jpeg><p>The Woman In Me by Britney Spears</p><p>On Sale 30% off</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
