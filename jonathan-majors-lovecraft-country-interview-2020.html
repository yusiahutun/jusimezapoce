I'm sweaty, stressed, and struggling to find a way to listen to Jonathan Majors on our Zoom call without turning off my A/C. Spoiler: I did not succeed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Majors joins our Zoom chat exactly on time, from Santa Fe, where he's been staying since February to film the western The Harder They Fall alongside Idris Elba. Naturally, production was delayed. He's smiling widely in a green tank top, snacking on popcorn as though this interview isn't a mid-pandemic industry obligation, but a carefree movie date. "No worries," he says of his current state, blasting a few seconds of upbeat music to reflect his mood.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps you can read that as a metaphor for Majors's year at large. Despite the cultural, political, and literal climate, the Yale School of Drama alum is thriving professionally. Fresh off the success of Sundance favorite The Last Black Man in San Francisco, the 30-year-old appeared in Spike Lee's latest joint, Netflix hit Da 5 Bloods. Majors describes Lee — or "Spike" — as "my uncle, my godfather, my big brother," labeling him chief among his many Hollywood mentors.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Stammtisch.604</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With a direct line to one of the most celebrated directors in history and a slew of prestigious acting nominations under his belt, Majors is embarking on his biggest project yet: Lovecraft Country. The HBO series, based on the novel by Matt Ruff, juxtaposes the horror of H.P. Lovecraft with the inherent racism of Jim Crow-era America. Helmed by Misha Green and produced by Jordan Peele and J.J. Abrams, the show is a behemoth in both subtext and production, matched only in scope by the monsters that follow Atticus Freeman (Majors) and Letitia "Leti" Lewis (Jurnee Smollett).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though it's an undoubtedly strange moment to be promoting a project, it's hard not to see Lovecraft Country as coming along at just the right time. "It speaks to what the soul of America is haunted by, what it's afraid of," Majors says of the series. "It contributes to the movement that is happening now. It is our call to arms as well as our victory chant."</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Jonathan Majors</h3><p>"I love being uncomfortable. I love feeling very revealed."</p><p>— Jonathan Majors</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You could call Lovecraft Country a departure from his established body of work but, if you look closer, every performance Majors gives is wholly original.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have this ritual," the actor tells me between bites, explaining how he uses the experience of traveling to his next job to get into character. "I use the transition of the airport, the flying from one place to another to really let go of the -isms, and the ideas that I have as an individual and kind of adapt and begin to morph." Those ideas and "isms" are clear throughout our conversation, as Majors punctuates his opinions with a passionate "come on," or reminisces near-poetically about his favorite pastime: going to the movies.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The process of losing himself in a character extends to dining as well. Atticus Freeman has lent his name to an Atlanta-based reservation or two. "Who's the table for? Atticus."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Given the intentional division between Majors and the characters he inhabits, he doesn't have a problem with watching himself on screen. In fact, he's a bit put off by actors who do. "Yeah, that's just bullshit," he says with a laugh.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love being uncomfortable. I love feeling very revealed. And when I watch a piece of work that I've done, I'm actually looking for that. How naked is this character? How truthful is this character? If it's truthful, there's automatically a separation."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read on below as Majors charms his way through questions about his celebrity crush, his favorite famous Robert, and the breakfast that got him through grad school.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>And just like that, Jonathan made a summertime beanie aspirational.

I'm sitting on the steps of Notre Dame. I'm 30 now, but in the dream I'm about 12. And I look out in the distance and I see this little boy walking up to me.

I always get it when I'm feeling kind of low about something. My brother shows up and hands me a red balloon. The only emoji I use on my phone is the red balloon. I don't emoji. For what?

It's a habit. I love it so much. The ritual of it. I like going on dates there. I like going to the matinee. I like taking my daughter there. It's just my favorite place in the world. I go there after auditions. I lived in New York City, I would go to the theater right after because it clears your mind.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So I miss it terribly, but I also understand the danger that we can put ourselves in as a society if we were to really open them up. Once the film is made, it's about the audience. You want the audience and right now you can't get the audience all together, but you could still have an audience. So I thank God that we have streaming service services, HBO Max, Netflix, et cetera, all of them. I don't want to name all of them, but all of them. Because it gives us access to a little bit of that nostalgia, the ritual of it.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_82-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Elizabeth Morris/HBO</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Name one place you've never been, but have always wanted to go</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_85-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Egypt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_87-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_89-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Well, first off, have you seen The Prince of Egypt?
