His rapid rise to fame was mainly due to his relationship with star actor, Sylvester Stallone, his father.

To this day, he is lauded for his impeccable acting skills in his first and last movie, <i>Rocky II. </i>After this stint, he went silent. Below is everything you need to know about his life story.</p><h2>Who is Seargeoh Stallone?</h2><p class=align-left>Seargeoh Stallone was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born</a> in 1979 in the US, and he is white. His parents are Sylvester Stallone and Sasha Czack. His dad featured in the <i>Rocky</i> Franchise among other top-selling movies, while his mom is famous for her works in <i>Long Lost Love</i>, <i>Vic, </i>and <i>Love of Life</i>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7067527ddde1e676.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Chris Isaak's wife? Here's everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Seargeoh’s parents divorced on 14th February 1985. At the time of their separation, Seargeoh was struggling with autism-associated challenges. Though separated, his parents always ensured that he received their eternal love and attention.</p><p class=align-left>His big brother, Sage Stallone, died from a heart condition in 2012. He was a famous actor and got lead roles in several films. With the secrecy that the family enjoys, some people tend to confuse Sage and Seargeoh Stallone.</p><p class=align-left>To clear the confusion, you first need to know that there are no Seargeoh Stallone TV shows. Seargeoh only appeared in the movie <i>Rocky II. </i>His <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">acting career</a> was short-lived due to his unique condition.</p><h2>Living with autism</h2><p class=align-left>Seargeoh Stallone was a quiet boy while growing up. By age three, his parents were worried about his silence and took him to the hospital, where doctors confirmed that he was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">autistic</a>. With his parents being in the limelight, they received endless advice to place their son in a special facility.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1ae0a7b46906f0ba.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Indio Falconer Downey: 5 things to know about Robert Downey Jr's son</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, Sylvester Stallone ignored the suggestion and chose to care for their son at home. He insisted that no special care would outmatch the home environment and family. Consequently, Stallone’s family set up a research fund to support the National Society for Children and Adults with Autism.</p><p class=align-left>The family resorted to making several adjustments in their daily lives to accommodate Seargeoh's needs. This ensured that he got homeschooled while undergoing therapies. By the time he was ten years, his speech and mobility had gradually improved as he learned to live life differently.</p><h2>What does Seargeoh Stallone do for a living?</h2><p class=align-left>There's no denying that Seargeoh is gifted uniquely. Although he did not live to become a renowned actor, those close to him refer to Seargeoh as the "silent genius." This attribute was even evident while growing up.</p><p class=align-left>As a child, he was brilliant and learned things quickly. His parents were supportive and even championed his feature in the movie <i>Rocky II</i>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c5dbb48e101cd300.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jace Norman bio: Net worth, wife, height, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><h2>Where is Seargeoh Stallone now?</h2><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Seargeoh’s life</a> has been kept private for years, and the paparazzi have not been able to learn much about him. However, it is presumed that Seargeoh lives with his dad, stepmom, and stepsisters in their La Quinta mansion in California. Other reports claim that he lives with his mom Sasha Czack.</p><p class=align-left>Despite his quiet life, many people are curious to know what he is up to. With Stallone's good looks and charming character, fans are curious to learn about Seargeoh Stallone’s wife too since he is of age.</p><p class=align-left>Frankly, there hasn’t been any report regarding the 42-year-old’s romantic life. Either way, Stallone’s personal life is respected by many.</p><p class=align-left>Seargeoh Stallone is a respected member of the Stallone legacy. Although he has lived a private life ever since he left the spotlight, there is no doubt that he is doing great. Hopefully, one day he will come out of the shadows and wow us again as he did in the movie <i>Rocky II</i>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c048078f820f740f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Regé-Jean Page: ethnicity, wife, net worth, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> published an article about <a href=#>scary phone numbers</a>.
