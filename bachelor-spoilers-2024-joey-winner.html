Joey’s Bachelor 2024 winner is Kelsey Anderson, a 25-year-old Junior Project Manager from Leesville, Louisiana, according to Reality Steve. His runner-up was Daisy Kent, a 25-year-old Account Executive from Becker, Minnesota.&nbsp;</p><p>Joey and Kelsey A. are engaged and still together after The Bachelor Season 28, according to Reality Steve. Joey gave his final rose to Daisy at the Final Rose Ceremony in The Bachelor Season 28 finale in Tulum, Mexico, and proposed to her, which she accepted and they got engaged.</p><p>Reality Steve confirmed that Joey picked Kelsey A. as his winner in February 2024. He originally reported that Daisy was Joey’s winner in January 2024, however, he later corrected himself when fans discovered that Joey and Kelsey A. were at what looked like the same house for what was believed to be a “<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.reddit.com/r/BachelorNation/comments/1awdv5j/proof_of_joeys_recent_shv/>Safe House Visit</a>,” a term also known as a “Happy Couple Weekend” to describe a secret date set up by producers between the Bachelor and his winner before the finale airs. According to a Reddit thread by user @sandbetweenhertoes, TikToks that Joey and Kelsey A. posted showed them in houses with the exact same microwave, cabinets, and backyard, which fans believed was confirmation that they were on a “Happy Couple Weekend.”</p><p>According to Reality Steve, Daisy realizes that she wasn’t Joey’s winner during their last date on The Bachelor Season 28 and goes to Kelsey’s room to tell her essentially, “It’s not me, it’s you. I’m gonna tell him that tomorrow,” which was a first for Bachelor Nation. “Once the final 3 rose ceremony happens and it’s down to two people, those two never interact with each other, whether it’s Bachelor or Bachelorette season. They don’t want them chatting each other up and what not. So Daisy must’ve made a plea to producers (or producers thought it’d be a ‘first’ for a storyline) to let a girl who thinks she’s not getting picked to go talk to the other girl,” Reality Steve wrote. “And that’s what they did.”</p><p>Reality Steve described Daisy and Kelsey A.’s conversation as “supportive” and “straightforward.” At the Final Rose Ceremony, Daisy arrives first and tells Joey what he told Kelsey A. and they had a positive breakup. The scene after his breakup with Daisy was shown in the first two minutes of The Bachelor Season 28 premiere, which showed Joey taking off his jacket and talking to producers before Kelsey A. arrives to decompress what Daisy told him.</p><p>For Joey’s engagement, it’s almost certain the ring was designed by Neil Lane, a celebrity jeweler, who has created engagement rings for The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise since 2008. In a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a>, former host Chris Harrison revealed that Bachelor Nation couples have to stay together for a certain amount of time, otherwise they have to return the free engagement ring to Neil Lane. “There’s some rule, after a certain number of years, you get to keep it anyway,” he said. “But after months… it goes back.”</p><p>Lane told <a href=#>StyleCaster</a> in 2016 that he doesn’t know where the rings go, but that he designs them with the hope that the couple stays together. “I make rings hoping that people stay together forever, but after they get the ring, I don’t have a say in it, and what happens after that, I don’t know,” he said. “Where the ring goes, I have to say, I don’t really know. I just say it goes to ring heaven.”</p><p>So who is The Bachelor 2024 winner, Kelsey Anderson? Kelsey is a 25-year-old Junior Project Manager from Leesville, Louisiana. Her Instagram handle is @_kelsey_anderson.</p><p>Kelsey A. listed her job on The Bachelor as an “Junior Project Manager.” According to her <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelsey-anderson-4b4a1b1b2/>Linkedin</a>, Kelsey A. works as a Project Assistant for Landmark Consulting in New Orleans, Louisiana. Before that, she worked as an Aftercare Teacher at Ascension Episcopal School in Lafayette, Louisiana. She graduated from Saint Leo University with an Associate of arts degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences, General Studies, and Humanities in 2021. She also earned a Bachelor of Business Administration from Saint Leo University.</p><p>Read Kelsey A.’s official <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://abc.com/shows/the-bachelor/cast/season-28-2024-kelsey-a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bachelor Season 28 biography</a> and fun facts ahead.</p><p>Kelsey A. is really something special. The Southern sweetheart spent most of her childhood growing up in Germany on a U.S. military base, and she’s extremely close with her big, loving family. The project manager now lives in New Orleans, where she enjoys taking the streetcar to new restaurants, walking around the French market, and having a picnic with her friends. Kelsey A. likes making thoughtful gifts for her partner when she’s in love, so hopefully Joey’s ready to be showered with homemade tokens of her affection. Kelsey A. wants to meet a man with a great sense of humor who’s understanding and who loves giving back as much as she does. She hopes to start her own nonprofit one day, and she’s hoping Joey is along for the ride.</p><p>Fun Facts:<br>• Kelsey A. only needs 12 hours to plan an international getaway.<br>• Kelsey A. often wonders how the world would be different if social media didn’t exist.<br>• Kelsey A. takes pride in her gift-giving abilities.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfl66ktMSlpqtlo6W8qrjEq6pmamBngW62zp6wZq%2BZo7umvo4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbachelor-spoilers-2024-joey-winner.html&text=Who%20Does%20He%20Pick%20on%20Season%2028%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbachelor-spoilers-2024-joey-winner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbachelor-spoilers-2024-joey-winner.html&title=Who%20Does%20He%20Pick%20on%20Season%2028%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbachelor-spoilers-2024-joey-winner.html&title=Who%20Does%20He%20Pick%20on%20Season%2028%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbachelor-spoilers-2024-joey-winner.html&title=Who%20Does%20He%20Pick%20on%20Season%2028%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbachelor-spoilers-2024-joey-winner.html&description=Who%20Does%20He%20Pick%20on%20Season%2028%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-pop-singer-terry-barber-calls-the-treasure-coast-home.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Pop Singer Terry Barber Calls The Treasure Coast Home">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./walking-outside-wet-hair.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happens to Wet Hair in the Winter">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
