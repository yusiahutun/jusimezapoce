Fans loved Eddie on the show and wished to learn more about the actor who played him in real life. Below you’ll learn about his height, dating, family, and what he said about his role on the show.</p><p>Learn more as this Joseph Quinn Bio proceeds.</p><h3><strong>Joseph Quinn On Stranger Things</strong></h3><p>Cult famous TV show Stranger Things season 4 premiered on 27 May 2022. One of the new faces we see on the show is British actor Joseph Quinn who plays Eddie Munson. Eddie is an 80s metalhead and master of Hawkins High’s premier Dungeons & Dragons group, the Hellfire Club.</p><p>While he ran the Hellfire Club in the show, he is yet to master the game himself in real life. Joseph told Entertainment Weekly, “I played my first game in L.A. when we were doing some press. I bought a book to try and understand what&nbsp;Dungeons & Dragons was about, and it didn’t agree with me. Though, I knew that wasn’t going to be my way in, as it were”.</p><p>Joseph shared with Entertainment Weekly, that his way into his character was through music. He added, “I listened to a lot of heavy metal and that was my… God, it’s impossible to not sound pretentious when you say it, but, yeah, that was my way in”.</p><p>The actor knows how to play guitar. He adored Gibson SG after watching Jack Black’s movie School of Rock. He opened up, “I’ve played since I was 7, and I’ve had huge breaks,” he admits. “I wouldn’t consider myself a brilliant guitarist, but I can play it. That was very lucky because those scripts came out, I think, at some point in the pandemic. I did start practicing pretty furiously”.</p><p>“He is both a metalhead and a dungeon master, a nerd, and punk,” said the show’s creators.</p><h3><strong>Joseph Quinn Net Worth</strong></h3><p>From his acting career, Joseph Quinn has already amassed $300 thousand in net worth.</p><p>Joseph Quinn has been performing since he was a small child. In nursery school, he performed a play. He was a drama scholar in high school, so he received a discount on my tuition on the condition that he pursue acting. In his final year of the sixth form, he wrote a play, which they performed in Edinburgh.</p><p>In the same year, the British actor was accepted into the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA). Joseph received his LAMDA Diploma in 2015. He is the sort who believes that actors are created rather than born. Furthermore, because of his time in drama school, he began to take acting seriously.</p><p>Curtis Brown was Joseph’s agent while he was at LAMDA. Joseph had previously attended Emanuel School, where he began in 2007.</p><p>Joseph honed his acting skills in the theatre, as do most performers. He appeared in plays such as Henry IV Part 1 (as Prince Hal), Titus Andronicus (as the main character), and The Seagull (as Konstantin) at LAMDA.</p><p>In addition, Joseph played Maurice in the TV drama Deathwatch at Print Room. He also played Dean in the Royal Court Theatre production of Wish List. In addition, he played Luke in the National Theatre production of Mosquitoes.</p><p>Postcode, Dickensian, Timewasters, Game of Thrones, Howards End, Les Miserable, Catherine the Great, Small Axe, Lethal White, and now the Stranger Things are some of his notable on-screen works to date.</p><p>In addition, the actor appeared in films such as Makeup and Overlord. His track record indicates that he has had success with period drama. Joseph considers sharing a stage with Olivia Colman at The National to be the proudest achievement of his acting career.</p><h3><strong>Is Joseph Quinn Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>The Brit actor’s phenomenal performance enabled him to steal the hearts of millions of Stranger Things fans but fans are eager to learn who stole his. The success of season 4 of Stranger Things and the popularity he gained because of it surely made fans wish to learn more of him beyond the TV screen.</p><p>More importantly, they are eager to learn if Joseph Quinn is dating someone or even married. But, hate to break it to you that he is very private when it comes to his personal life. Joseph hasn’t bothered to shed some light on his dating life publicly. In addition, we have nothing to keep on going based on his Instagram posts because he is strictly professional on the platform.</p><p>So, based on all that we have, Joseph appears happily single.</p><h3><strong>Joseph Quinn Age</strong></h3><p>When Stranger Things Season 4 premiered in May 2022, Joseph Quinn was 29 years old.</p><h3><strong>Joseph Quinn Family</strong></h3><p>Joseph Quinn was born in South London. To this date, his parents and siblings are away from the limelight. So, we are yet to learn about his family life. But, while speaking with Joseph shared about his youthful times and having older friends which he relates to being on Stranger Things.</p><p>He explained, “I definitely had a couple of friends that were older than me when I was growing up, in that confusing period of 13-17. Life changes very quickly, and what you’re exposed to changes. I think having people just that little bit older than you that have been through it was always very comforting to me. I think that’s what Gaten and I tried to establish with this relationship. It was just brotherly love”.</p><h3><strong>Is Joseph Quinn On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Joseph Quinn, in May 2022, hopped on Instagram. With only one post, he has shared on (<a href=#>@josephquinn</a>), Joseph has already earned 165k followers and a verified account.</p><h3><strong>Joseph Quinn Height</strong></h3><p>According to the actor’s profile on Curtis Brown, Joseph Quinn stands tall at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 meters).</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Joseph Quinn Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>We are yet to learn about Joseph Quinn’s birthday.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Joseph Quinn From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Joseph Quinn hailed from South London, England.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>When Did Joseph Quinn Make His Acting Debut?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>According to IMDB, Joseph Quinn made his on-screen acting debut in 2011 with the TV show Postcode where he played the minor role of Tim in one episode.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmo6ejmr2pedCuoKemXZe2sHnHnqCgoKRisaLAyKeeZp6RoratxYysq6uZnpyys3nToaCnn6Nk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjoseph-quinn-bio-height-dating-family-stranger-things.html&text=Meet%20Actor%20Joseph%20Quinn%21%20His%20Bio%2c%20Height%2c%20Dating%2c%20Family%2c%20Stranger%20Things&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoseph-quinn-bio-height-dating-family-stranger-things.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoseph-quinn-bio-height-dating-family-stranger-things.html&title=Meet%20Actor%20Joseph%20Quinn%21%20His%20Bio%2c%20Height%2c%20Dating%2c%20Family%2c%20Stranger%20Things" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjoseph-quinn-bio-height-dating-family-stranger-things.html&title=Meet%20Actor%20Joseph%20Quinn%21%20His%20Bio%2c%20Height%2c%20Dating%2c%20Family%2c%20Stranger%20Things" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjoseph-quinn-bio-height-dating-family-stranger-things.html&title=Meet%20Actor%20Joseph%20Quinn%21%20His%20Bio%2c%20Height%2c%20Dating%2c%20Family%2c%20Stranger%20Things" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoseph-quinn-bio-height-dating-family-stranger-things.html&description=Meet%20Actor%20Joseph%20Quinn%21%20His%20Bio%2c%20Height%2c%20Dating%2c%20Family%2c%20Stranger%20Things" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-2020-tony-award-nominations-have-been-announced.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 2020 Tony Award Nominations Have Been Announced">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lady-gaga-victorias-secret-hat.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lady Gaga Wears a $1 Million Hat to the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
