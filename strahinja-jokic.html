Jokić played youth basketball for Vojvodina Srbijagas.</p><p>He caught the eye of bigger clubs and joined Mega Basket in the summer of 2012.

He agreed to a maximum deal of $148 million before the 2018–2019 NBA Season.</p><p>By being selected for his first NBA All-Star and All-NBA Team, he returned the team’s belief in him. Alongside Jamal Murray, he guided the squad to their first conference championship since Melo joined the squad in 2009 during the 2019–2020 season.</p><h4><span>Recent career</span></h4><p>For the 2020–2021 season, Nikola and his squad had high expectations. He increased his output from All-NBA to MVP levels. He finished with a season average of 26-11-8 and beat out Joel Embiid and Steph Curry to win MVP.</p><p>In a 113-96 blowout of the Miami Heat on November 8, 2021, he and the opposition player Markieff Morris were both sent to the bench after Markieff pushed Nikola, who then hit Markieff in the back. The NBA said the next day that they had suspended for a one-game, with the no-pay ban.</p><p>On December 27, Joki tied his career-high of 22 rebounds and finished with 26 points, 8 assists, 2 steals, and 2 blocks in a 103-100 win over the Los Angeles Clippers.</p><p>Strahinja Jokić was the first player since Charles Barkley in 1988 to record 25 or more points, 20 or more rebounds, and 5 or more assists in back-to-back games.</p><p>He signed a five-year $264 million supermax contract extension with the Nuggets on July 1, 2022, making it the most expensive contract in NBA history.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements>Body Measurements</span></h2><p>This man stands<strong> 7 feet</strong> tall and his weight is unknown.
