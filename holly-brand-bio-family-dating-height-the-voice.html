Judges Niall Horan and Chance The Rapper quickly followed.</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, even after Holly ended her performance with a whistle note, Blake Shelton didn’t hit his button which led Kelly to ask him. “What is wrong with you? Is this thing on?” Then, she proceeded to praise Holly, “I’m so happy right now. That was incredible.”</span></p><p><span>Niall then claimed that he almost hit the buzzer on her first note, and she reminded him of singer-songwriter Maren Morris — which is a big praise. The judge then ended his persuasion with, “I’m telling you, we’re going to do big things together if you come with me. Please!”</span></p><p><span>Next spoke Chance The Rapper who also agreed with Niall as he praised her for hitting every note. “The whistle note took me out,” he said.</span></p><p><span>Finally, Kelly again stated that she grew up on country music and understood the contestant’s voice better than the other two coaches. This also ultimately persuaded Holly to join her team.</span></p><p><span>But though the three judges wanted her, it was clear that Holly wanted to be on Team Blake. She even brought a picture of herself from when she was 10 and got the chance to open for Blake in concert.</span></p><p><span>It was a disappointment not to see Blake facing Holly while she sang. And it’s not just us. The whole internet’s surprised that Blake didn’t turn his chair around.</span></p><p><span>“For real Blake, why ain’t you turn your chair around? Holly’s got PIPES!!!,” a tweet read. While another said, “@blakeshelton #TheVoice Dude wake up… Holly’s a winner… I think you’re trying to throw the season…”</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Holly Brand?</b></h3><p><span>Holly Brand was 22 years of age when she auditioned for The Voice in 2023.</span></p><p><span>But she was 21 when she won Miss Mississippi in 2021.</span></p><h3><b>Holly Brand Family</b></h3><p><span>Holly Brand comes from a family of four.</span></p><p><span>Her mother, Connie Brand is History Instructor who worked at </span><i><span>Meridian Community College</span></i><span>.

But she only gained the spotlight in June 2021, after winning Miss Mississippi and going on to compete in the 100th Miss America pageant. Several years before this, Holly was also named “Mississippi’s Outstanding Teen” in Miss Mississippi Teen 2017.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, Holly couldn’t take home the Miss America title. But she was awarded a $1000 non-finalist talent scholarship after she performed “House of the Rising Sun.” Infact, she was awarded a full scholarship to </span><i><span>The University of Alabama </span></i><span>for being the state representative of an organization in 2017.</span></p><p><span>Holly graduated from </span><i><span>The University of Alabama </span></i><span>in May 2021.</span></p><h3><b>Is Holly Brand Dating Anyone?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, as of March 2023, Holly Brand is dating her boyfriend Hayden. She says Hayden is the person who “just makes life sweeter.”</span></p><p><span>Ending 2022 with Hayden, she also took to her IG, on the first day of 2023 to write, “Ending a pretty amazing year with an even more amazing guy! 🤍 2022 was filled with some truly unforgettable moments. My cup runneth over. 💓 2023, I am so ready for you!!”</span></p><p><span>Reportedly, Hayden worked as a substitute teacher at </span><i><span>Kelly</span></i><span> in 2021.
