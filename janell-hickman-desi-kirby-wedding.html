Hickman and Desi J. Kirby just happened to be in Ottawa, Canada, for a weekend trip when Desi decided to propose—with a ring that he’d been holding onto for months. Desi, who works at a boutique art fabrication studio in New York City focused on custom furniture, first met Janell, a beauty editor and creative consultant, in late 2008 at a friend’s going-away party. “I don’t know if it was love at first sight, but I was definitely interested,” Desi tells BAZAAR Bride of what began as friendship and grew into love.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The couple moved in together in mid-2015 and had been together for a decade at the time of their engagement two years later. Desi had been trying to figure out how to propose to Janell when they found themselves up north for the weekend. The location had no significance, but as travel lovers, it was more about being in another new place together.</p><img alt="desi and janell" title="desi and janell" width=4480 height=6720 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/matt-and-tish-photography208matt-and-tish-1606346738.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Matt and Tish Photography</span></p><img alt="janell's engagement ring" title="janell's engagement ring" width=862 height=1266 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2020-11-25-at-6-28-32-pm-1606346923.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Matt and Tish Photography</span></p><img alt="desi and janell" title="desi and janell" width=4480 height=6720 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/matt-and-tish-photography204matt-and-tish-1606346777.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Matt and Tish Photography</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though the proposal setting wasn’t sentimental to the duo, the ring was extra special and designed with the bride in mind. Desi tapped a friend who had previously worked at Tiffany & Co. and Louis Vuitton to design something traditional yet minimal for Janell. What resulted was a stunning emerald-cut diamond solitaire on a gold band, which he used to spontaneously pop the question he’d been harboring for months.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After their engagement, Janell and Desi set out to plan a destination wedding, albeit a domestic one. The original plan was a celebration with more than a 120 guests at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://lospoblanos.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Los Poblanos" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Los Poblanos</a>, a historic farm and inn near Albuquerque, New Mexico. In planning the wedding, the couple headed southwest twice—first to look at possible venues, meet with a few preliminary vendors, and take some engagement photos. Janell found husband-and-wife photographers <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.mattandtish.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Matt and Tish" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Matt and Tish</a> on Instagram, liked their aesthetic and energy, and made plans for the photo shoot. In keeping with the landscape and the laid-back vibes of New Mexico, she donned a colorful <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://fenoel.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fe Noel" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Fe Noel</a> two-piece ensemble that echoed the colors of the Southwestern scenery; Desi sported a denim <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.levi.com/US/en_US/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Levi’s data-vars-ga-product-id=c1099255-60f8-44d0-8967-111adc9820c1 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.levi.com/US/en_US/ data-product-url=https://www.levi.com/US/en_US/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.levi.com%2FUS%2Fen_US%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=d47f4e38-3926-49bd-bf4c-4b1987fecb9e class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Levi’s</a> shirt and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://zara.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Zara data-vars-ga-product-id=7acb4ed8-4c5b-4e83-ba7a-07d6bbe6b804 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=http://zara.com/ data-product-url=http://zara.com/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=http%3A%2F%2Fzara.com%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=3d5bd875-246c-42ff-8307-cfc01f8ac044 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Zara</a> pants.</p><img alt="desi and janell" title="desi and janell" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2-1606346815.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Matt and Tish Photography</span></p><img alt="janell and desi" title="janell and desi" width=4704 height=3136 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/matt-and-tish-photography495matt-and-tish-1606346850.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Matt and Tish Photography</span></p><img alt="engagement shoot" title="engagement shoot" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/4-1606358925.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Matt and Tish Photography</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They went back to New Mexico a second time to do a tasting and finalize the details. But once the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic set in, their venue made the difficult decision not to hold any weddings on-site for the remainder of the year and through all of 2021. For this couple, waiting until 2022 wasn’t on the table—so a safe, small wedding closer to home had to be.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Once Janell and Desi came to the decision that they definitely wanted to get married in 2020, it was on to plan B. “The goal was to find a new location that was similar to what we had envisioned, kind of like a farm,” Janell explains. “I just happened to Google <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.brooklyngrangefarm.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Brooklyn Grange" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Brooklyn Grange</a>; it was a really cool rooftop farm in Brooklyn at the Navy Yard. It kind of had the same vibe, the same aesthetic.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Complete with its views of the Manhattan skyline, Brooklyn Grange was available on Sunday, September 20, just three months away from when Janell came across it. The timeline was tight—but waiting longer meant contending with potentially inclement weather or temps too low to be comfortable celebrating outside. With the priorities whittled down to a chic, safe, local, and intimate celebration outdoors, Janell and Desi jumped right into planning an entirely different wedding.</p><img alt="janell and desi" title="janell and desi" width=2333 height=3500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brian-fraser-5m5a7931-1-1606346963.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Brian Fraser</span></p><img alt="janell and desi" title="janell and desi" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1a-1606346995.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Brian Fraser</span></p><img alt="janell and desi" title="janell and desi" width=3500 height=2333 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brian-fraser-5m5a8038-2-1606347018.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Brian Fraser</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The couple had originally spoken to Fallon Carter of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://falloncarterevents.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fallon Carter Events" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Fallon Carter Events</a> when planning their New Mexico wedding, but had decided not to fly a planner out for that celebration. When their wedding was refashioned as a local event that needed to be planned in three months, they circled back. Janell admits that she was hesitant to hire a planner, because she’s “type A and super organized,” but in the end, having someone to listen to all her ideas and pull them together was beyond helpful, particularly after she’d poured plenty of energy into planning an event that could no longer take place. Fallon kept on top of the ever-changing regulations and safety protocols in New York City, the general logistics and design of the event, and honoring the couple’s initial plans whenever possible along the way.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Tuesday prior to the wedding, the pair signed their marriage license. Since they couldn’t go to the courthouse to make it official, they decided to make it feel special on their own.

I worked with Stephanie White from Odylyne the Ceremony, and she did everything from sending sketches to helping me find inspiration,” Janell explains. “She’s based in L.A., so everything was done remotely via email, telephone, and Google Hangouts. To start, she offered three ideas, like, ‘This is what this dress could look like,’ and we picked one that we thought would work best. I measured myself at home, and then just had fingers crossed that it would work out.” And work out it did—with the help of LOHO Bride co-founder <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/wedding/photos/a21948634/loho-bride-christy-baird-brian-doxtator-five-wedding-gowns/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Christy Baird" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Christy Baird</a>, “She put my dress together in a month and a half,” Janell says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And the designer didn’t just create the dress. “She went above and beyond,” the bride explains. “The dress originally came with a very sheer cape. Stephanie wanted to make something more special, so she designed a very intricately detailed cape; it was embroidered with sequins in a leaf pattern that was really beautiful.” The cape not only gave the elegantly simple sheath a bit of drama for the ceremony, but worked double duty as an alternative to a classic veil.</p><img alt="bridal gown sketch" title="bridal gown sketch" width=1512 height=1718 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/otc-janell-sketch-1-1606358581.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Odylyne The Ceremony</span></p><img alt="first look" title="first look" width=4032 height=2688 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/noem8387-1606358609.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Noemie Marguerite</span></p><img alt="janell and desi" title="janell and desi" width=2688 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/noem8416-1606358634.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Noemie Marguerite</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While her ensemble was created on the West Coast, it was finished in New York, with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.alterationspecialists.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alteration Specialists" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Alteration Specialists</a> handling the final fittings.

They then joined their 30 guests on the rooftop of Brooklyn Grange, where a sign illustrated by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://soosoostudios.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Soo Kim" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Soo Kim</a>, a former coworker of Janell’s, marked the occasion. The illustration incorporated a line drawing of the bride and groom based on a photo they’d taken together in New Mexico, commemorating the merge of their original wedding plans and their newly planned nuptials. It wasn’t the only signage, as circumstances warranted one that read, “Spread love, not germs,” set out by a bottle of lavender-scented hand sanitizer produced by their original venue in New Mexico, which has a lavender field on-site.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The couple’s intimate ceremony on the roof was also designed with a nod to the Southwest. “Fallon was really good about not making it feel super kitschy,” says the bride. LaParis Phillips of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://brooklynblooms.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Brooklyn Blooms" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Brooklyn Blooms</a> brought elements native to New Mexico into the decor, like cacti and dried grasses; and she kept that same aesthetic in mind when creating Janell’s colorful yet gestural bridal bouquet. When it came to the floral design, Janell trusted the talent she collaborated with for the big day. “I didn’t really give LaParis too much direction, but our color palette was the colors of the sunset, since we wanted something that tied back to New Mexico. Nothing that was too bold; think more muted tones, like oranges and peaches, with blues and shades of white,” says Janell.</p><img alt="jumping the broom" title="jumping the broom" width=2688 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/noem8735-1606358808.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Noemie Marguerite</span></p><img alt="ceremony kiss" title="ceremony kiss" width=4032 height=2688 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/noem8711-1606359243.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Noemie Marguerite</span></p><img alt="just married" title="just married" width=4032 height=2688 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/noem8763-1606359282.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Noemie Marguerite</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The ceremony was livestreamed to the remainder of the couple’s original guest list, and plans were made to ensure all who attended virtually felt welcome. “Fallon made sure everyone enjoyed themselves and felt present—regardless of if they were there in person or not,” says Janell. “She even created a Pinterest board to give virtual attendees guidance for the garden-chic attire.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though this was far from the wedding Janell and Desi originally planned, it didn’t stop emotions from running high—in all the best ways. “I didn’t necessarily cry walking down the aisle, but I did feel really emotional leading up to getting married, after getting married, and a lot of excitement. Despite us being together for so long, even when Desi proposed, it was one of those things that you know is happening; you know it’s coming—but it still feels very emotional and surreal,” says Janell.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Emotions were heightened thanks to a performance by Keanna O’Quinn, the lead singer of the group <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.honeyandvinylmusic.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Honey + Vinyl" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Honey + Vinyl</a>, who read a story Janell wrote about canceling the wedding and having to start over. Keanna was so moved by it that she reached out to Fallon about how she could be involved, and ended up performing a mix of reggae, R&B, soul, jazz, and gospel music during the ceremony. “It was a lot of chill music,” Janell says. “We wanted it to be something that people would recognize and would want to sing along to, not something distracting.” Post-wedding, guests were begging for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/janell-desi/pl.u-6mo4lAWfmRNgX5 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the playlist" data-vars-ga-product-id=1ae72386-8fe0-48b6-9c26-226c8cf4bc61 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/janell-desi/pl.u-6mo4lAWfmRNgX5 data-product-url=https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/janell-desi/pl.u-6mo4lAWfmRNgX5 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Fplaylist%2Fjanell-desi%2Fpl.u-6mo4lAWfmRNgX5" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=1f39439d-902b-418e-baf3-f1c636df334c class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">the playlist</a>.

For Janell, Fulton created a half-circle diamond ring accented with an emerald, which left space on the finger to accommodate her engagement ring. For Desi, she crafted a traditional, hammered band.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After the couple jumped the floral-adorned broom and were declared husband and wife, they headed to a spot on the perimeter of the roof for post-ceremony portraits with photographer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.noemie-marguerite.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Noémie-Marguerite class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Noémie-Marguerite</a>. Noémie had documented one of the couple’s friend’s weddings, and Janell had seen a series of her photos and resonated with her style. “She’s really chill, which was important to me; I didn’t want someone who was too high energy or anxious,” Janell recalls.

Janell had attended a party she'd played the year before, and had booked her for their original wedding in New Mexico.

The fragrant keepsakes were slipped into muslin pouches atop the dinner napkins for guests to depart with.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After everyone headed home, Janell changed into a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://mestizanewyork.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Mestiza class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Mestiza</a> dress paired with an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.intermixonline.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Intermix data-vars-ga-product-id=fe4e1a29-210b-495e-a04a-d0282c13e34e data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.intermixonline.com/ data-product-url=https://www.intermixonline.com/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://intermix.ga3c.net/c/3006986/638169/10202?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intermixonline.com%2F&subId1=har&subid3=xid:{xid}" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"f8d45c71-1022-4f17-a7d6-02c7bb0fcdd7","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{"trackonomics":{"merchant_id":"43352","merchant_name":"INTERMIX","network_name":"IR","network_id":"3","product_id":"459","product_name":"Harper&#39;s BAZAAR US","product_external_id":"459","product_url":null}},"network":{"id":"a332915a-6423-480f-9153-e3973f438607","name":"Trackonomics","metadata":{}},"product_metadata":{"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5":{"link":"https://intermix.ga3c.net/c/3006986/638169/10202?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intermixonline.com%2F&subId1={subid}","network_name":"ir","appended_link":"https://intermix.ga3c.net/c/3006986/638169/10202?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intermixonline.com%2F&subId1={subid}&subid3=xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2023-06-21 14:53:05.178492"},"7399c57a-aa06-4b9c-87ff-bb598c3203f1":{"link":"https://intermix.ga3c.net/c/3006986/638169/10202?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intermixonline.com%2F&subId1={subid}","network_name":"ir","appended_link":"https://intermix.ga3c.net/c/3006986/638169/10202?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intermixonline.com%2F&subId1={subid}&subid3=xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2023-06-21 13:46:45.824589"},"530bacd4-96b2-4cfe-a9a6-1fbd7c749e22":{"link":"https://intermix.ga3c.net/c/3006986/638169/10202?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intermixonline.com%2F&subId1={subid}","network_name":"ir","appended_link":"https://intermix.ga3c.net/c/3006986/638169/10202?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intermixonline.com%2F&subId1={subid}&subid3=xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2023-06-21 15:02:01.507283"}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=68b9dfed-7980-4b77-bb39-c383f3d063d5 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Intermix</a> jacket for a date night with Desi—their first of many as newlyweds. “We decided to go to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vinegarhillhouse.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vinegar Hill House" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Vinegar Hill House</a>. It’s kind of tucked away, and it was closing [for the night]. We had to call them and we were like, ‘We just got married. We’re so sorry. We’re late for a reservation.’ But it was nice because we sat in the back garden, and they brought us champagne.” Desi had a pork loin, while Janell had pasta. They sipped cocktails, enjoyed the romantic setting, and recapped how they spent their days leading up to their first look in the hotel lobby. “It was kind of like a blur to me until we went out to dinner that night," Desi says. "Then, I actually had time to relax and talk to Janell."</p><img alt="cake cutting" title="cake cutting" width=2688 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/noem9372-1606359754.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Noemie Marguerite</span></p><img alt="guests on the dance floor" title="guests on the dance floor" width=4032 height=2688 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/noem9440-1606359873.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Noemie Marguerite</span></p><img alt="janell and desi" title="janell and desi" width=2688 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/noem9417-1606359817.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Noemie Marguerite</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=59 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though the event they’d refocused their energy on planning had come and gone, there was more celebrating to do. The night after the wedding, the couple’s pals hosted a “friendception” on the roof of a friend’s home in Brooklyn. They invited 30 of Janell’s and Desi’s closest friends, hired a DJ, decorated with streamers, and kept it a secret from Janell. This was the after-party the couple had skipped out on, and it was officially time to turn up, dance, and have a good time—with views of the city, again, providing the ultimate backdrop.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=60 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Along with their wedding plans, Janell and Desi also reconsidered their honeymoon. After their wedding that never was in New Mexico, the couple intended on road-tripping across the Southwest, but they weren’t comfortable with the long, cross-country flight needed to get them there from New York. When they decided to wed in Brooklyn, a road trip was still in the cards—it was just a matter of where.</p><img alt="janell and desi" title="janell and desi" width=4032 height=2688 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/noem9409-1606359786.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Noemie Marguerite</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=62 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Janell’s interior designer friend, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/hello_lulu/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lisa Lu" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Lisa Lu</a>, was instrumental in finding an ideal honeymoon destination.

The two drove upstate just as the leaves began to change colors and booked the spot’s Carriage House, adjacent to the historic main building. The cozy suite boasts a soaking tub and a fireplace, and they were greeted by a bottle of bubbly. While the year had brought some unfortunate curveballs, there was one that further added to their newlywed bliss. “Because of COVID, there weren’t a lot of people there,” Desi says. “It felt like everything was there [just] for us.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Shira Savada spent a decade overseeing the real wedding content for Martha Stewart Weddings and now runs her own consulting business within the wedding industry.
