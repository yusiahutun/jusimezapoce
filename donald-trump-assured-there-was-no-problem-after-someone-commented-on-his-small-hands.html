The former President whose hoping to get back into the White House has mentioned it himself multiple times. It seems to be a sensitive spot for the bussinesman.</strong></p><p>The story of <a href=#>Donald Trump</a>‘s ‘small hands’ – which he rejects – gathered speed ahead of his victory at the 2016 election. But it was actually pointed out by a Vanity Fair editor 30 years beforehand, and it still got The Apprentice star riled up, reportedly. So much so, Donald, married to <a href=#>Melania Trump</a>, would apparently send photographs of his hands to prove they weren’t small by circling them in gold Sharpie.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-idea-of-donald-trump-s-small-hands-started-decades-ago>The idea of Donald Trump’s ‘small hands’ started decades ago</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-578546876-1024x683.jpg><p>Graydon Carter, former editor of Vanity Fair magazine, described the billionaire as a “short-fingered vulgarian” in Spy magazine. He admitted he penned the 1988 comment “just to drive him a little bit crazy” 30 years later.</p><p>And, according to Carter, it did.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a> in an editor’s letter in Vanity Fair: “To this day, I receive the occasional envelope from Trump. There is always a photo of him—generally a tear sheet from a magazine. On all of them he has circled his hand in gold Sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers.</p><p>“I almost feel sorry for the poor fellow because, to me, the fingers still look abnormally stubby.”</p><p>“The most recent offering arrived earlier this year, before his decision to go after the Republican&nbsp;presidential nomination,” Carter wrote.</p><p>“Like the other packages, this one included a circled hand and the words, also written in gold Sharpie: ‘See, not so short!’ I sent the picture back by return mail with a note attached, saying, ‘Actually, quite short.'”</p><p>But it seems to be an attribute Carter likes doing, winding people up. As he came out last year to allege he didn’t see <a href=#>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s marriage</a> lasting beyond a few years.</p><p>Then Senator Marco Rubio brought up Donald Trump’s ‘small hands’ to supporters in 2016, his rival at the time.</p><p>He said: “He is taller than me, he’s like 6′ 2”, which is why I don’t understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 5′ 2.</p><p>“Have you seen his hands? And you know what they say about men with small hands- “</p><p>He waited for the crowd to react</p><p>” -You can’t trust them,” Rubio joked.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-s-brought-it-up-himself>He’s brought it up himself</h2><p>After comments from Carter and Rubio, Trump even spoke about it himself, including at a Republican debate in Detroit in March 2016.</p><p>He told followers: “And I have to say this, I have to say this. [Rubio] hit my hands.”</p><p>“Nobody has ever hit my hands. I have never heard of this. Look at those hands,” he said holding his up to the audience.</p><p>Donald Trump continued: “Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands – if they are small, something else must be small.”</p><p>“I guarantee you there is no problem,” Trump assured his fans. “I guarantee you.”</p><p>And in a Washington Post <a href=# rel=nofollow>interview</a>, he went on to say they were “normal”, “great”, a “good size”, and “slightly large, actually”.</p><p>Then while at a Houston hurricane relief shelter in September 2017, he mentioned their size again. This was when he was trying to put on a pair of latex gloves.</p><p>“My hands are too big!” he said, before helping to serve meals to families affected by the devastation of Hurricane Harvey.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2WEcLDOp5ilnF2pv7a5z2aYrKulp7KledOhnKudXayutHnNqGSpqp%2BXuaa5jJqdrZ2iYsCwucSopZ5lk6S6rrHNrZydZZ%2Bjeqm10maqppmcoXqprc2dqmg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdonald-trump-assured-there-was-no-problem-after-someone-commented-on-his-small-hands.html&text=Donald%20Trump%20assured%20there%20was%20%27no%20problem%27%20after%20someone%20commented%20on%20his%20%27small%20hands%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdonald-trump-assured-there-was-no-problem-after-someone-commented-on-his-small-hands.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdonald-trump-assured-there-was-no-problem-after-someone-commented-on-his-small-hands.html&title=Donald%20Trump%20assured%20there%20was%20%27no%20problem%27%20after%20someone%20commented%20on%20his%20%27small%20hands%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdonald-trump-assured-there-was-no-problem-after-someone-commented-on-his-small-hands.html&title=Donald%20Trump%20assured%20there%20was%20%27no%20problem%27%20after%20someone%20commented%20on%20his%20%27small%20hands%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdonald-trump-assured-there-was-no-problem-after-someone-commented-on-his-small-hands.html&title=Donald%20Trump%20assured%20there%20was%20%27no%20problem%27%20after%20someone%20commented%20on%20his%20%27small%20hands%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdonald-trump-assured-there-was-no-problem-after-someone-commented-on-his-small-hands.html&description=Donald%20Trump%20assured%20there%20was%20%27no%20problem%27%20after%20someone%20commented%20on%20his%20%27small%20hands%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jenelle-evans-mom-barbara-family-vacation-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jenelle Evans &amp;amp; Mom Barbara Pose For Family Vacation: Photos  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-much-does-beyonce-weigh.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celebs Who've Revealed Their Weight">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
