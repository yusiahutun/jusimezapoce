The 30-year-old former <a href=#>One Direction</a> member and singer-songwriter behind such huge singles as As It Was and Watermelon Sugar was single himself back in 2020. However, he’d be very fortunate if he could say that was the worst of his luck on that February 14th, because he has since opened up about being mugged on that very night…</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-1393470391-1024x750.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-styles-was-once-mugged-at-knifepoint-on-valentine-s-day>Harry Styles was once mugged at knifepoint on Valentine’s Day</h2><p>When appearing on iconic radio host Howard Stern’s SiriusXM radio show in March 2020, Harry walked listeners through his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">experience</a> of being mugged just one month before.</p><p>While walking back from a friend’s house in Hampstead, London, late at night on Valentine’s Day, he came across a group of men he immediately became suspicious of. To stay alert, he turned his headphones off and crossed the street.</p><p>Unfortunately, this didn’t prevent any confrontation. He was followed but admitted he didn’t suspect the men knew who he was. When asked if he smoked weed, Harry replied no, and that’s when it started.</p><p>“What have you got on you?” he was asked, so Harry handed over the money he had on him. “Not worth fighting over,” Howard commented, to which Harry instantly agreed.</p><p>However, the ordeal didn’t end there. Upon seeing the singer’s headphone wire poking out from his jacket, one of the men demanded he hands over his phone, “stop f***ing around”, and unlock it. It’s then that one of the muggers revealed he was carrying a knife.</p><p>“Mate, I can’t, I can’t unlock my phone” Harry insisted, standing his ground. “And then the guy’s like, ‘You’ve got 10 seconds to unlock your phone.'”</p><p>It was after some quick deliberation that Harry decided to hand it over after all, but then the man insisted again that he needed to unlock it, to which Harry again refused. He was ultimately thinking about how “annoying” it would be to wipe the device after.</p><p>“There’s a little pond behind them and I thought I’d throw it in the pond and be like, ‘But neither of us have it right,’” he remembered thinking.</p><p>“But then they would have stabbed you,” Howard cut in, and Harry agreed he didn’t want to “p**s them off” any more than he had.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-styles-managed-to-make-a-lucky-escape>Harry Styles managed to make a lucky escape</h2><p>“The lights changed, and there was, like, two cars coming,” Harry recalled, seeing an opportunity to be saved and keep his phone.</p><p>“I felt an opportunity,” he explained, running into the road and attempting to stop the car. However, he was well aware that, from the driver’s perspective, he’s a “madman” in the road you wouldn’t let into your car, and they didn’t, and neither did the next car.</p><p>Now he had some distance from them, on the other hand, he ran to the village area near his home. He commented that he is normally wearing running gear, yet this was the one night he was wearing corduroy flares, shoes, etc.</p><p>He survived the harrowing ordeal all the same and seemed in good spirits about it in hindsight, refusing to let it scare him. Hilariously, he joked it wouldn’t have happened had he not been on his lonesome on Valentine’s Day. We feel you, Harry—it’s not much fun!</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2aDcLTAq6myZaOpxq2x0maumqtdpLuksYymrKCflZl6osCMpKWinpWlvKq602akmqapYsamrdGsZKKmpKR6p63MnmSopl2rrq2xza2gp52jYrGixY4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fharry-styles-was-once-mugged-at-knifepoint-many-years-into-fame-on-valentines-day.html&text=Harry%20Styles%20was%20once%20mugged%20at%20knifepoint%20many%20years%20into%20fame%20on%20Valentine%27s%20Day&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fharry-styles-was-once-mugged-at-knifepoint-many-years-into-fame-on-valentines-day.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fharry-styles-was-once-mugged-at-knifepoint-many-years-into-fame-on-valentines-day.html&title=Harry%20Styles%20was%20once%20mugged%20at%20knifepoint%20many%20years%20into%20fame%20on%20Valentine%27s%20Day" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fharry-styles-was-once-mugged-at-knifepoint-many-years-into-fame-on-valentines-day.html&title=Harry%20Styles%20was%20once%20mugged%20at%20knifepoint%20many%20years%20into%20fame%20on%20Valentine%27s%20Day" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fharry-styles-was-once-mugged-at-knifepoint-many-years-into-fame-on-valentines-day.html&title=Harry%20Styles%20was%20once%20mugged%20at%20knifepoint%20many%20years%20into%20fame%20on%20Valentine%27s%20Day" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fharry-styles-was-once-mugged-at-knifepoint-many-years-into-fame-on-valentines-day.html&description=Harry%20Styles%20was%20once%20mugged%20at%20knifepoint%20many%20years%20into%20fame%20on%20Valentine%27s%20Day" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./youtube-video-shows-old-guy-smash-driver-s-window-using-baton-alberta-canada-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="YouTube video shows old guy smash drivers window using a baton in Alberta, Canada">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./danielle-bradbery.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Danielle BradberyBiography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
