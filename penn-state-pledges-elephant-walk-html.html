additional charge for underage drinking on the night in question.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Meanwhile, grand jury testimony from Detective David Scicchitano which has been released in the case revealed that in the eight days before Piazza's death, Craig Heimer purchased $1,179.30 worth of alcohol for the fraternity.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Those purchases consisted of 'numerous cases of Crown Rouse vodka and Natural Light Beer, 15 cases of Four Loko and multiple boxes of wine' according receipts inspected by Detective Scicchitano.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Authorities claim that part of that massive liquor haul was later consumed by pledges in the hours before Piazza fell approximately 15 feet down a stairwell and sustained an injury that led to his death after the young men present refused to call 911 for 12 hours.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In text messages obtained by authorities which were sent in the days prior to the pledge event, one of the brother's can be seen asking Heimer to make large alcohol runs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Heimer was one of the few members of the fraternity who was old enough to legally purchase liquor.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In one text exchange, Michael Schiavone, who was also 21, asks Heimer if he could purchase '175 [Four] Lokos, seven cases of Natty [Natural Light], on crate of [Crown] Rouse.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Heimer then asked how much money he should get, how many bottles were in a crate of the vodka and where he could get that many Lokos.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Schiavone responded by texting that it would be $800 case, the crate contained 'six handles' and gave him the name of a local store that had close to 200 cans of Four Loko in stock.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A week later Schiavone again texted asking Heimer to purchase 'six Rouse.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Shortly after, Heimer responded: 'Handles are in your room.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was just hours later that the pledge activities began and Piazza suffered his fatal fall.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A fraternity brother who was
