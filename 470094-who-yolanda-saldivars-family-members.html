However, she lost both positions a short time before murdering her.</p><h2>How did Yolanda meet Selena?</h2><p class=align-left>Selena met Yolanda in 1991 at a concert. Her niece was the singer's childhood friend. At the time, she was a newly qualified nurse who offered to start the Selena Fan Club.</p><p class=align-left>She eventually found her way into the Quintanilla family. She gained their love and trust and became a close friend and confidant of Selena.</p><h2>Yolanda Saldivar's family members</h2><p class=align-left>Who is Yolanda Saldívar's husband? The former nurse was never married. Her only closest and known relatives are her parents and siblings. Here is what you need to know about them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ed8778c9e24aeeea.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Jocko Willink's wife?

In 1971, he moved his family to Lake Jackson, Texas, United States, so that he could start a record label.</p><p class=align-left>He also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">served as a head</a> waiter at a Mexican restaurant called Jacala. It was located in the West End. Unfortunately, not much has been disclosed about Frank. Therefore, it is impossible to tell where he is and what he is doing now.</p><h3>Juanita Saldívar</h3><p class=align-left>Juanita is the mother of the convicted <a href=#>Yolanda Saldivar</a>. She was born and raised in Nuestra Senora del Refugio, in Mexico.

Yolanda was raised alongside seven other siblings. Unfortunately, not much about him is in the limelight.</p><h3>Maria Elida Saldívar</h3><p class=align-left>Yolanda Saldívar's sister <a href=#>Maria</a> Elida was never in the spotlight until her name came up during Yolanda's alleged embezzlement of funds. Selena and her father confronted the former nurse about her mismanagement and misappropriation of funds.</p><p class=align-left>They<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> also discovered the</a> fan club's bank account was registered under Maria Elida.
