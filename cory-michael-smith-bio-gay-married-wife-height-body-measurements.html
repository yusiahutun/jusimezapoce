The American actor is still one of the most popular characters in the Fox television series in which he portrays Edward Nygma.</p><p>Apart from Gotham, the actor has appeared in many other movies and television shows, and he is now definitely a popular face on the screen.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Cory Michael Smith Bio.</strong></h2><p>To get to know him better, Cory Michael Smith was born on November 14, 1986, in Columbus, Ohio, United States. There the actor and his older brother, Chad, were raised by his parents.</p><p>For his education, Smith attended Hillard Darby High School and graduated there. From there he went to Otterbein University, where he studied art-music theatre and jazz piano.</p><p>Since acting seems so natural to him, it is very hard to believe that acting was not his first dream. He first wanted to become a lawyer and then a pianist before he decided to become an actor.</p><p>Smith is not one of the oldest actors there is. The 30-year-old did not start as an actor until 2014 when he made his debut at Camp X-Ray. That same year, he appeared in another short film, Dog Food. In 2015 he starred in another film, Carol, and in 2017 his next film was Wonders Truck.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Elijah Wood And How Much He Made From The Lord Of The Rings</a></strong></p><p>The next film in which Cory Smith will appear is 1985 and will be released in 2018.</p><p>What has made the actor even more popular is not his movies, although he has done quite well, the TV shows he has appeared in. His most popular role was in Gotham, where he has played since 2014. Another TV show he has starred in is Oliver Kitteridge, also in 2014.</p><p>In front of the screen, Smith had a good trip to the stage where he appeared in several productions including Cock Aka The Cockfight Play (2013), The Shaggs: The Philosophy of the World (2013), and Assassins (2017).</p><p>Smith has two nominations for all his efforts: Critics’ Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Role in a Film/Miniseries for his role in Olive Kitteridge, 2015, and Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Villains for his role in Gotham, 2017.</p><p>One of his biggest fans on Gotham is his mother, who he says loves Batman. “I don’t think there’s a show she could be more excited about than me being a part of,” he said.</p><p>Aside from acting, he is a fan of Brandon Stansell, and he recently visited his Facebook page to help the singer drum when he was trying to raise money for his first full album.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Gay/ Married/ Wife</strong></h2><p>As an actor, it is only natural that the spotlight is on your whole life and sexual orientation. For Michael Smith, there are very few rumors about whether the actor is gay or not. However, the actor has not yet spoken out to claim or deny that he is gay, but he has not yet been associated with anyone.</p><p>Unless you want to count in Gotham when Penguin -Robin Lord Taylor- declared that he has feelings for his Ed Nygma- Corey Michael Smith.</p><p>However, Cory Michael Smith is not married. However, he has been in a relationship before. That was in 2014 when he was supposed with the beautiful actress Emilia Clarke from Game of Thrones.</p><p>It is not known how long the two statistics are dated, but it is known that the two are no longer a couple and Emily has dated other men. Smith for his part has neither said nor rumored to have dated anyone before or after Emily.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Mackenzie Mauzy Bio, Height, Dating, Married, Boyfriend</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Cory Michael Smith Net Worth</strong></h2><p>It is obvious that Smith is not one of the oldest actors, considering that he has not even been in Hollywood for up to 10 years. Nevertheless, the actor, with his astonishing efforts so far, has a fortune estimated at around $2 million.</p><p></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Cory Michael Smith Body Measurement</strong></h2><p>A good-looking man with a rich charisma, Smith has a body that is easy to appreciate. This is all the more true as he was a height of 6′ 0 (1.83 m) and a bodyweight of 75 kg.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ksLC%2B2GakopuYlrKtedKmoK2gXZe2sHnGmrBmpZGnv6qxw2auop6VYrWmtcahq2aan5nGbrnEmqquqpWisq%2FA0mg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcory-michael-smith-bio-gay-married-wife-height-body-measurements.html&text=Cory%20Michael%20Smith%20Bio%2c%20Gay%2c%20Married%2c%20Wife%2c%20Height%2c%20Body%20Measurements&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcory-michael-smith-bio-gay-married-wife-height-body-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcory-michael-smith-bio-gay-married-wife-height-body-measurements.html&title=Cory%20Michael%20Smith%20Bio%2c%20Gay%2c%20Married%2c%20Wife%2c%20Height%2c%20Body%20Measurements" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcory-michael-smith-bio-gay-married-wife-height-body-measurements.html&title=Cory%20Michael%20Smith%20Bio%2c%20Gay%2c%20Married%2c%20Wife%2c%20Height%2c%20Body%20Measurements" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcory-michael-smith-bio-gay-married-wife-height-body-measurements.html&title=Cory%20Michael%20Smith%20Bio%2c%20Gay%2c%20Married%2c%20Wife%2c%20Height%2c%20Body%20Measurements" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcory-michael-smith-bio-gay-married-wife-height-body-measurements.html&description=Cory%20Michael%20Smith%20Bio%2c%20Gay%2c%20Married%2c%20Wife%2c%20Height%2c%20Body%20Measurements" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sky-sports-f1-tv-contract-28122388.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="F1 fans make plea as Sky Sports extends TV deal to 2029 which gets mixed reaction">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./aa-ponte-preta-24-football-club-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aa Ponte Preta: 24 Football Club Facts">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
