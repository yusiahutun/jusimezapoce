She comes from a large family and is the youngest of 6 girls.</p><p>As a child, Beth was very active and was constantly outdoors. Consequently, she played softball, tennis and rode horses as a child. At the age of 13, Beth moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, where she attended Cimarron-Memorial High School, which she graduated with honors in 1996.</p><p>Even before she achieved fame, Beth was always a very lovable person. In high school, she was voted “Most Admired Senior” and was the prom queen in her final year. She was also president of the student body. During her childhood and youth, Beth developed a passion for photography and was a member of the photography club in high school.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>We Bet You Didn’t Know These Facts About Melissa O’Neil</a></strong></p><p>In her early twenties, Beth moved to Los Angeles and began modeling, hoping to expand her knowledge of photography and also travel the world. However, after a short time, she began to win commercial appearances and then found herself auditioning for film roles.</p><p>She made her acting debut in 2000 with a short film entitled The Summer of My Deflowering. The following year, she started on the small screen with a guest role in Spin City and Undressed.

Beth was chosen to play the role of “The Thief,” one of the main characters in Leverage, an action drama about how a team, which includes a con artist, uses her skills to fight corporate and state injustices inflicted on ordinary citizens.

For her role, Beth was nominated three times for the Saturn Award for the best-supporting actress on television.</p><p>During her time at Leverage, Beth had a guest appearance at NCIS and received further film appearances.</p><p>After her break with the TNT series, she told the media</p><p>“It’s so strange not knowing what your life is going to be. I am optimistic. And when Leverage (2008) comes to an end, I have lots of ideas for other things. You can’t really sit and wait for things to come to you.</p><p>After Leverage ended, Beth got a recurring role in Criminal Minds.
