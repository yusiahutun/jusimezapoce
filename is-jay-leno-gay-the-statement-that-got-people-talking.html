There have been many headlines asking, “Is Jay Leno gay?” However, despite the media’s attempts to verify, the claims have remained.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jay-Leno-Presents-1024x683.jpg><p>So, is Jay Leno really gay? Not according to him or his longtime wife. However, there was that one time he made a statement that had people thinking and speculating about it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Jay_Leno_Gay></span>Is Jay Leno Gay?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, Jay Leno is not gay. The former TV host has been married to the same woman, Mavis Leno, for more than four decades. One would think that would be enough to dispel any gay rumors about him; however, it has not.&nbsp;</p><p>It started in late 2020 when a series of online adverts that said “Meet Jay Leno’s Gorgeous Husband” started circulating. The adverts included pictures that captured Leno posing with different men who were seemingly his husband.&nbsp;</p><p>There was no truth to the pictures and they turned out to be clickbait designed to lure readers. As time passed, Tumblr ads also started getting around, all talking about the comedian’s alleged husband.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>They created speculation</a> among fans about the talented man’s sexual leanings but one only needs to search Google to find proof of his happy heterosexual marriage which is at odds with gay idealism.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from the fake ads, another reason that has made people suspect Leno of being gay is his open acceptance of same-sex relationships. He once <a href=#>made an appearance</a> on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” where he spoke about the subject and gave his support claiming the world will not end because of it.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jay-Leno-and-Ellen-DeGeneres-1024x683.jpg><p>Are these reasons enough to speculate about Leno’s sexual orientation? Absolutely not. Thus, Jay Leno, as far as all the evidence, or the lack of it, is concerned, does not swing that way.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Jay_Leno></span>Who is Jay Leno?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Jay Leno’s career</a> in showbiz started when he was in college. While he attended Emerson College in Boston, he worked a part-time gig as a stand-up comedian.&nbsp;</p><p>After gaining more confidence and experience in his craft, Leno moved to Los Angeles in the 1970s and started writing for television. Much later, he <a href=#>took over</a> as the permanent host of “The Tonight Show” following Johny Carson’s retirement in 1992.&nbsp;</p><p>He spent several years as the host, enriching the project, before stepping back in 2009 to launch a prime-time show.&nbsp;</p><p>Not long after, he returned to “The Tonight Show” as a host and remained for another four years until 2014. Leno now hosts his own show, “Jay Leno’s Garage,” and has done so since 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>Leno is currently married to Mavis Leno with no kids, a fact that may have acted as fodder for the homosexuality rumors.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Jay_Lenos_Wife></span>Who is Jay Leno’s Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Jay Leno’s wife</a> is Mavis Nicholson -Leno, a philanthropist famous as a chairperson of the Feminist Majority Foundation. She also has experience in showbiz as a producer who worked on the documentary, “Period. End of Sentence.”</p><p>She was born in San Francisco, California, and is four years older than her comedian husband. Mavis is not as famous as her husband, and she seems to like it that way. The gorgeous woman is known to always fly under the radar except she has to accompany her hubby on his numerous outings.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair ran into each other in 1976 at a comedy club. She had watched him perform at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles, California, and was impressed.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jay-Leno-and-Wife-Mavis-Leno-1024x683.jpg><p>Mavis thought he was charismatic, and after the show ended, <a href=#>she met him backstage</a> to congratulate him on his performance. She became one of his biggest pillars of support before he finally landed his big job on “The Tonight Show.”&nbsp;</p><p>It did not take them long to realize they were a perfect fit, and four years later, they tied the knot even though Mavis had always been against the idea of marriage. She allegedly married Leno to take advantage of his insurance, but they have remained married happily.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mavis_Did_Not_Want_Kids></span>Mavis Did Not Want Kids&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Leno and his wife have no kids to speak of because they both decided not to have any. Mavis had never wanted children, and fortunately for her, Leno had nothing against it.&nbsp;</p><p>According to an old interview, Mavis claimed that the television show “The Honeymooners” helped her decide not to become a parent. She thought it trapped women, and as early as age 8, she had confessed her desire not to have kids to her mother.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Secret_to_Their_Long-lasting_Union></span>The Secret to Their Long-lasting Union<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Leno’s relationship with Mavis has lasted longer than some people have lived – a great feat considering how tumultuous celebrity relationships can be.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the longevity of their marriage, people have wondered what has kept them together and Leno once answered. He told the Today Show:</p><p>“Here’s the secret: You marry your conscience…You marry the person you wish you could be. That’s what I did.”&nbsp;</p><p>Leno claimed that he has a selfish profession and that Mavis, who works selflessly for others, was the perfect balance for him. Another clear indication that the comedian likes women, and is not <a href=#>gay</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktrR5yZqwZqSVo7xus8CyZK2glWLAta3TnqSepqRiwamt02aeqKxdpbKwvMueZK2ZnKC2r7OO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-jay-leno-gay-the-statement-that-got-people-talking.html&text=Is%20Jay%20Leno%20Gay%3f%20The%20Statement%20That%20Got%20People%20Talking&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-jay-leno-gay-the-statement-that-got-people-talking.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-jay-leno-gay-the-statement-that-got-people-talking.html&title=Is%20Jay%20Leno%20Gay%3f%20The%20Statement%20That%20Got%20People%20Talking" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-jay-leno-gay-the-statement-that-got-people-talking.html&title=Is%20Jay%20Leno%20Gay%3f%20The%20Statement%20That%20Got%20People%20Talking" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-jay-leno-gay-the-statement-that-got-people-talking.html&title=Is%20Jay%20Leno%20Gay%3f%20The%20Statement%20That%20Got%20People%20Talking" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-jay-leno-gay-the-statement-that-got-people-talking.html&description=Is%20Jay%20Leno%20Gay%3f%20The%20Statement%20That%20Got%20People%20Talking" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rodarte-target-anniversary-collection.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Rodarte Pieces in Target's Designer Anniversary Collection">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./socialite-dated-kevin-costner-kicked-police-officer-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hollywood socialite who dated Kevin Costner for three years and partied with Robert De Niro and Jack">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
