One such couple is <a href=#>Adam Driver</a>, the actor best known for playing Kylo Ren in the Star Wars series, and his wife, fellow thespian Joanne Tucker.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-how-did-adam-driver-and-joanne-tucker-meet>How did Adam Driver and Joanne Tucker meet?</h2><p id=par-2_103>Long before Adam Driver rose to fame on the HBO show Girls and then on Star Wars, he served in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">United States Marine Corps</a>. He suffered a mountain biking accident prior to getting deployed overseas and was medically discharged. Feeling a bit at loose ends, Driver enrolled in the famous Juilliard School for drama. According to Driver’s accounts of his time at school, he enjoyed the classes but realized that many of the other students found him intimidating and intense. One student that Driver got along with exceptionally well was Joanne Tucker, who shared Driver’s interests in acting and the theater arts.</p><p id=par-3_74>Driver and Tucker started dating while in school, though the exact date of their relationship anniversary has not been disclosed. Driver has stated that Tucker not only helped him to adjust to life outside of the military but that she helped teach him about certain refinements, including fancy cheese and “how not to spit on the sidewalk.” The two have been together ever since and tied the knot in 2013, in a private ceremony.</p><p id=par-4_48>They expanded their family by adopting a rescue dog, whom Driver named “Moose.” Tucker gave birth to the couple’s first child, a son. In February 2023, it was revealed they were expecting a second child. Driver and Tucker reportedly live in New York, in the Brooklyn Heights area.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-does-joanne-tucker-do>What does Joanne Tucker do?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_77>Like her husband, Joanne Tucker is an actor and a Juilliard graduate. Her film credits include roles in independent films like Gayby and Loft, the film The Report, the TV series American Rust, and she also made a cameo appearance in Girls, alongside her husband. Tucker has also proclaimed her love for theater work. She also co-founded Adam Driver’s nonprofit organization Arts in the Armed Forces, which produces great works of American theater for primarily military audiences.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_37>Tucker currently serves as the Artistic Director of Arts in the Armed Forces, and that seems to occupy a good portion of her time. Reportedly, she and Driver have collaborated on another major project as well.</p><h2 id=h-driver-and-tucker-are-a-very-private-couple>Driver and Tucker are a very private couple</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-7_98>Along with her husband, Joanne Tucker has chosen to mostly avoid social media. Neither of them has public Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook accounts. Adam Driver has been very vocal in his dislike of social media, and it seems as though his wife shares his opinion. However, they occasionally pop up on the Arts in the Armed Forces social media accounts, as is it a passion project for them both. In addition, Joanne Tucker frequently accompanies Driver to various red carpets, including the 2019 Golden Globes, where he was nominated as Best Supporting Actor for his work in BlackkKlansman.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqbuMoqpmmZSWum6w0aKtnqqjYsSqssRmoaiZnqOybsDUnKKeql6dwa64jg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-adam-drivers-wife-joanne-tucker-html.html&text=Who%20is%20Adam%20Driver%27s%20Wife%2c%20Joanne%20Tucker%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-adam-drivers-wife-joanne-tucker-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-adam-drivers-wife-joanne-tucker-html.html&title=Who%20is%20Adam%20Driver%27s%20Wife%2c%20Joanne%20Tucker%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-adam-drivers-wife-joanne-tucker-html.html&title=Who%20is%20Adam%20Driver%27s%20Wife%2c%20Joanne%20Tucker%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-adam-drivers-wife-joanne-tucker-html.html&title=Who%20is%20Adam%20Driver%27s%20Wife%2c%20Joanne%20Tucker%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-adam-drivers-wife-joanne-tucker-html.html&description=Who%20is%20Adam%20Driver%27s%20Wife%2c%20Joanne%20Tucker%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./amit-sadh.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Amit Sadh dating?
