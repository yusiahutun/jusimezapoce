They were engaged almost two decades ago and share a daughter,&nbsp;Noelle Robinson. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Baby mamas and daddies can be tricky relationships to handle, especially during parenting and moving on from each other. However, Leon and his fiancee had it easy.&nbsp;</p><p>Also check out:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Jase Robertson's Happy Family Life with His Wife & Kids</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>They did not end things on bad terms and have always maintained an amicable relationship. Unfortunately, Cynthia never got to become Leon's wife, and they parted ways before the wedding, but she still holds a special place in his heart.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Leon Robinson with His Could-Have-Been Wife and Daughter (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bravo</a>)</strong></p><p>That's because she is the mother of his child, who means the most to him. They have nothing but sweet words to say when talking about each other.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A lot of that has to do with their daughter. They wanted her to have a loving set of parents and not be affected by their split. They might not have been able to become husband and wife, but they make wonderful parents.&nbsp;</p><p>He stated his relationship with Cynthia in an <a href=# rel="follow noopener">interview</a>, "We are a family through this child. We are always supposed to do what is best for one another and respect one another, but most of all, do what is best for the child, and the child needs to see two loving parents." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He added,</p><p>Even if we are not together as a couple, we can still love and respect one another; that&nbsp;is what our daughter [Noelle] needs to see in order to grow up.</p><p>He further said that Cynthia would always be a big part of his life.&nbsp;</p><p>"So, for me, the child comes first. We have a child together and that is something that will never change, and no matter how many women I may have had in my life, only one of them has given me a child. So, for me, she has the highest respect of anyone,” he said. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Similarly, Cynthia also shared some sweet words for Leon in an Instagram comment that read, "Thank you for our beautiful daughter [Noelle]. She is truly the best combination of both of us [and] is blessed to call you her dad. Thank you for being such a great father."</p><p>Furthermore, she even said Leon&nbsp;was her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">soulmate</a>, so the connection is definitely there between the two.</p><p>Read More On:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Dom DeLuise's Sons Follow His Footsteps</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Certainly, Leon shares a beautiful family with his ex even though they have sorted ways and found a new love. Cynthia is now the wife of Mike Hill, and Leon sent his best wishes to the newlywed couple.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Likewise, his name has also been linked with a few other women. He was rumored to be dating Samantha Garrett and Kirbie Wallace earlier, but there's no confirmation on that&nbsp;subject.</p><p>On the other hand, he has been spotted multiple times in public with&nbsp;Ed Bradley’s former wife, Patricia Blanchet. So rumors about them dating have been floating around recently. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But, Leon has not shared further details about his relationship or spouse for now. His discreteness has also led some to wonder- is Leon Robinson gay?&nbsp;But the reality is that he is straight.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>However, anytime he does share any updates, you know where to look for the news!</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunC8jqWcqKZdp7yjtc2spqdlp56zpnnWnpudoZ6ceqWt1KCfrZ2iY7W1ucs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fleon-robinson-wife-wedding-daughter-html.html&text=Leon%20Robinson%27s%20%26quot%3bSoulmate%26quot%3b%20Could%20Not%20Be%20His%20Wife%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fleon-robinson-wife-wedding-daughter-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fleon-robinson-wife-wedding-daughter-html.html&title=Leon%20Robinson%27s%20%26quot%3bSoulmate%26quot%3b%20Could%20Not%20Be%20His%20Wife%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fleon-robinson-wife-wedding-daughter-html.html&title=Leon%20Robinson%27s%20%26quot%3bSoulmate%26quot%3b%20Could%20Not%20Be%20His%20Wife%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fleon-robinson-wife-wedding-daughter-html.html&title=Leon%20Robinson%27s%20%26quot%3bSoulmate%26quot%3b%20Could%20Not%20Be%20His%20Wife%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fleon-robinson-wife-wedding-daughter-html.html&description=Leon%20Robinson%27s%20%26quot%3bSoulmate%26quot%3b%20Could%20Not%20Be%20His%20Wife%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./old-i-74-bridge-to-be-demolished-with-explosives.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Old I-74 bridge to be demolished with explosives">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dan-and-shay-2024-heartbreak-on-the-map-tour.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dan + Shay Announce 2024 Heartbreak on the Map Tour">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
