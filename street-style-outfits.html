However, StyleCaster may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.</p><p>Hi, it’s me, the new Fashion & Lifestyle Editor here at StyleCaster. As a longtime beauty writer, making the switch to working in capital-F Fashion was more than a little bit daunting. Especially when you factor in that my first week on the job just so happened to be New York <a href=# id=auto-tag_fashion-week data-tag=fashion-week>Fashion Week</a>. I had to look office-appropriate, feel comfortable enough to run from show to show, and still be on-trend enough to get stopped for a few <a href=# id=auto-tag_street-style-4 data-tag=street-style-4>street style</a> snapshots. It wasn’t easy to create the perfect <a href=#>street style outfits</a> that still worked well for my first week as an ~official~ fashion editor, but according to my Instagram likes, I did a pretty good job.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>I’d be lying if I said I woke up every morning of Fashion Week and threw on whatever thrilled me. It’s my first Fashion Week as an editor, not my first Fashion Week ever, y’all. I knew the drill! In reality, NYFW requires a lot of prep, and I had four key references when <a href=#>styling my looks</a>. First, a few brands very kindly lent me pieces to be styled, which made a few of my <a href=# id=auto-tag_outfits data-tag=outfits>outfits</a> no-brainers. Second, my subscription to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Rent The Runway</a> really came in clutch, as I was able to wear an outfit to an AM show, drop it off at the Rent The Runway store, and have a new look delivered to my apartment for the very next day. Third, I thrifted a LOT of fun accessories. When you can’t splurge on designer duds, jazzing up your current wardrobe with unique thrift finds can really change the game. Last but not least, I had my very own closet, of course. There’s no better time to explore your own wardrobe and get creative with what you’ve already got than while prepping some NYFW slays.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unknown-1.jpeg><h2>Day One:</h2><p>Here I am posing with <a href=# rel=nofollow>my far-more-stylish friend</a>, Belle! Afaf Zahira, the genius Creative Director of <a href=# rel=nofollow>Heurueh</a>, blessed me this (very cold) Fashion Week by lending me a few beautiful faux fur coats from her company. This pink-and-brown fur situation is my fave, and I wore it not once, but twice this week. While I’m all for wearing my fave pieces often on the reg, it’s rare to repeat during NYFW, so that says a lot about how much I loved this coat!</p><p>Because it was rainy and gloomy outside, I stuck with cheery bright pink but kept my overall look comfortable, with basic black boots and the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Topshop Rose Long Sleeve Shirtdress</a>. I paired it all with a classic black Chanel bag and a matching (lol) black umbrella. Since the look was so low-key, I really didn’t expect to get my photo taken, but because my friend, Belle, was also wearing a pink faux fur Heurueh coat, the photogs couldn’t get enough of us together. Shout out <a href=# rel=nofollow>Will from @collectiveframes</a>, aka my all-time fave street style photographer! Pro tip: If you’re scared to get your photo taken solo, coordinate with a friend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nyfw1.jpg><h2>Day Two:</h2><p>‘Twas on this day that I snapped with a full athleisure fit. My joggers, long-sleeved shirt, and yellow bomber are <a href=# rel=nofollow>all by Pyer Moss</a>, and I rented the trio using my trusty Rent The Runway subscription. Y’all, I wouldn’t have survived Fashion Week without it! (Use my code RTRFAM11C7505 for a discounted membership if you feel the urge!) I styled the $1,035 three-piece set with some rain boots I picked up at River Island during a recent London trip, and avoided any rain-ruined hair by throwing mine up in a basic pony.</p><p>To distract from the underwhelming hairdo, I whipped up this black-and-yellow graphic eye look. I felt VERY nervous with the dramatic makeup and updo, but almost everyone I saw agreed this was my best look of the week.&nbsp;Good makeup can really make or break a ‘fit, y’all. To think, sweatpants and rain boots were my top NYFW slay!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unknown-2.jpeg><h2>Night Two:</h2><p>When Day Two was winding down, a surprise landed on my desk. Okay, in my email inbox: a ticket to Christian Siriano’s Fall/Winter 2020 show. I was over the moon! I knew right away that I needed something a little more glam than my Pyer Moss athleisure look, so I ran home and threw on a look Victoria’s Secret had gifted me for just such an occasion. I paired one of their bustiers (The <a href=# rel=nofollow>Lightly Lined Bustier</a> is the most similar style currently available) with the stunning <a href=# rel=nofollow>Button Midi Skirt in “Bronzed Olive”</a>&nbsp;and grabbed one of my go-to thrift finds, a small black beaded evening bag. Was I cold? Yes. Did I slay? Yes. Zero regrets.</p><p>While I usually snag a second-row seat (Sometimes, for smaller shows, even front row!), I found myself fourth row for Siriano, a seat I was still thrilled to have. In fact, it gave me the perfect view of the star-studded front row across the way. I watched Heidi Klum, Alicia Silverstone, and Leslie Jones as closely as I watched the actual models—I even snapped <a href=# rel=nofollow>this video of Leslie cheering on Coco Rocha</a>, which then went viral, getting posted by Saint Hoax, InStyle, and even Christian Siriano himself. No big deal!!! (It was a very big deal.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unknown-4.jpeg><h2>Day Three:</h2><p>This outfit is brought to you by <a href=# rel=nofollow>SKIMS Body Tape</a>. Not really, but it should be, because I relied on it heavily to achieve this, um, perky look. Atop my tape I wore a <a href=# rel=nofollow>Proenza Schuller&nbsp;</a><span class="_b4693b _b4693b _a32b92" aria-hidden=true>Wildflower V-Neck Dress, which typically costs a cool $1650, but you guessed it, I scored it using Rent The Runway. I also rented the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Diane Von Furstenberg&nbsp;</a></span><a href=# rel=nofollow>Navy Soiree Top Handle Bag</a>, thereby saving myself $548 bucks.&nbsp;<span class="_b4693b _b4693b _a32b92" aria-hidden=true>I topped off my look with the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Lele Sadoughi Sugar Petite Padded Candy Jeweled Headband</a>, which got me approached by many a hair blog photographer whilst posing for street style photos. For a little contrast, I threw on the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Steve Madden Kinga Boot in “Blue Snake.”</a> I wouldn’t normally clash like this in my daily life, but at Fashion Week, anything goes!</span></p><p>It was in this outfit that I answered some questions for <a href=# rel=nofollow>a Jimmy Kimmel segment</a>, in which I knew I would most likely get made fun of, because, well, that’s what Jimmy Kimmel segments are all about. He asked questions about baseball scandals and my friend (Belle again!) and I could only respond with “Huh?!” on repeat. Looking back at the clip now, though, the most embarrassing part was my not-so-TV-appropriate cleavage. I loved this look, but will not be wearing it again, LOL.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unknown.jpeg><h2>Day Four:</h2><p>On this day, I was generously gifted a look by <a href=# rel=nofollow>Petite Studio</a>, a brand that caters specifically to petite bodies. This was especially cool as someone who doesn’t have the tall-and-skinny model body type so often seen at fashion-related events (Do better, NYFW!).&nbsp;As a 5’1 curvy gal, I was beyond excited to give their stuff a go, and I was ultimately quite pleased with my picks. I snagged this blue-and-stone-colored set from the brand’s coming-soon Spring collection, and inspired by the color-blocking, I paired one of my Steve Madden blue Kingas with one stone-colored boot from the depths of my closet. I cinched my waist with a white fur <a href=# rel=nofollow>Moschino belt</a>&nbsp;I gifted myself for my birthday last year from Nordstrom Rack.</p><p>This look is not my usual style, and I admit, I was a little nervous to see what people would think. Especially because of the boots! I did a poll on <a href=# rel=nofollow>my Instagram Stories</a> asking how people felt about the mismatched shoes (So very Carrie Bradshaw, if I do say so myself!) and 73% of voters were in favor. I doubt I’d try it again, but I’m glad it was a hit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unknown-6.jpeg><h2>Day Five:</h2><p>Five days in, my incredible hot pink Heurueh coat made its second appearance. Get a load of that lining! This time around, I paired it with the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Topshop Floral Ditsy Flounce Midi Skirt</a>&nbsp;and the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Marissa Webb Emmerson Oxford Shirt</a>. Another rainy day, I kept my shoes simple with comfortable black boots and saved my hair from frizz with the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Lele Sadoughi Jet Mixed Crystal Headband</a>.</p><p>This look was so low-key, but it ended up being a great lesson in accessories: making my basic button-down and skirt Fashion Week ready was easy with a bold coat and hair accessory! If there were two standout staples for me this fashion week, they were faux fur and funky headbands. I was mostly backstage checking out the shows’ beauty looks for StyleCaster on this day, but when a last-minute change allowed me to stay for the Libertine show, I still felt glam enough to attend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unknown-3.jpeg><h2>Night Five:</h2><p>Is it obvious that I went to Topshop before Fashion Week began? Here I am in yet another Topshop piece, the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Smudge Mesh Long Sleeve Midi Dress</a>, which gave me serious Fuzzi vibes. I reached for my classic black Chanel bag yet again, plus the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Steve Madden Dakota boots in “Black Suede,”</a> and bam! A look was born! As you can tell by the photo, I was really feeling myself.</p><p>That said…At this point in the week, my friends and Insta followers were hardcore gassing me up, and I had over 200 DMs praising my cool new job, my stylish outfits, and my “super fun life.” A reality check for anyone who felt that way: My feet were KILLING me, I was majorly stressing about if I was over-posting, and after being surrounded by models and fashion’s elite all week, I did not feel very cute. Instagram is a very fun highlight reel, but don’t be fooled. I love Fashion Week, but there’s more (stress) than meets the eye!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unknown-7.jpeg alt="street style photos nyfw Bella" width=503 height=670 sizes="(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Bella Gerard</p><h2>Day Six:</h2>Ah, the final day. I woke up with shin splints after a week of running around! Because of this, I paired my nautical-business-casual look with my <a href=# rel=nofollow>Puma Rise Sneakers</a>, and while I was worried I’d be judged for not wearing heels or boots, I actually received a ton of compliments. Who would’ve thought! Up top, I had on two Rent The Runway gems I paired together: this <a href=# rel=nofollow>Tory Sport Breton Stripe Knit Skirt</a>, originally $248, and the Victoria / <a href=# rel=nofollow>Tomas Green Striped Blazer</a>, originally $155. I’m also wearing a graphic tee from Anthropologie that I found in the sale section, which features drawings of Oprah Winfrey and Anna Wintour with the phrase “Win-Win.” How iconic is that? I also wore a simple, braided black headband, because if you haven’t been able to tell, I wasn’t in the mood to wash my hair this week. What can I say, Fashion Week is exhausting!<p><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
