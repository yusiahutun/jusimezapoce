The show, which has aired over 200 episodes since debuting in 2012, is so successful that it’s spawned two popular spinoffs, <a href=#>Chicago P.D.</a> and Chicago Med.</p><p>Chicago Fire centers on the personal and professional lives of firefighters and paramedics working at the fictitious Firehouse 51 in the Windy City. The cast of characters has evolved considerably since the show debuted over ten years ago, and fans keep tuning in to see their ups and downs and experience the intense and thrilling world of first responders.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/GettyImages-153293881-e1701872066982.jpg><p>In anticipation of the new season debuting on January 17, we’re catching up with the Chicago Fire cast.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jesse Spencer as Matthew Casey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/1-1.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jesse Spencer</a> was a series regular on House before he took up residency at Firehouse 51 as a Lieutenant-turned-Captain Matt Casey.&nbsp;Spencer took a brief hiatus from the series in season 10, but returned for the season 11 finale.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Melbourne, Spencer became well-known for his role as Billy Kennedy in Australia’s favorite soap opera, Neighbours.

During season four of the series, he began dating fellow firefighter Stella Kidd and the two eventually married in season 10.
