Thankfully, there are a number of great kits that make the hair removal process easy and safe. To find the best at-home waxing kits, we put in the research — uncovering top-rated options, and consulting with estheticians and beauty professionals for their top-tier recommendations and tips for best results.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-gigi-mini-pro-hair-removal-waxing-kit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gigi Mini Pro Hair Removal Waxing Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Gigi Mini Pro Hair Removal Waxing Kit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0t7vSTd0STZFWiO6T0nUDhjoUe8=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GiGi-Mini-Pro-Hair-Removal-Waxing-Kit-6df5d5d1ca9c4849b9f0037335199546.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This kit comes with a post-wax cooling gel that calms skin and reduces redness and bumps.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The wax can stick to the bottom of the heater if it’s not cleaned out properly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a one-and-done waxing kit, the Gigi Mini Pro has everything you need (like seriously, everything). It comes with an array of helpful tools, including a wax heater with an adjustable temperature, soft cream wax, pre- and post-waxing lotions that reduce inflammation, petite, small, and large spatulas that work for any body part, and more. Additionally, the wax is made with good-for-your-skin ingredients like honey, which prevents dryness, and chamomile, which works to soothe sensitive skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the process may seem intimidating at first — it is five steps — the whole process takes under an hour.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Use the brand’s slow grow lotion every day to maintain soft, smooth skin.

This handy kit comes with 34 pre-waxed strips that are pre-cut and specially made for the face and bikini line. The unique ridges on the strips allow hair to easily latch onto the wax, meaning it’s quickly and painlessly pulled from the root (no matter how coarse it might be).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To use this, warm up a wax strip by rubbing it in your hands. Once warmed, smooth the strip onto the skin in the direction of hair growth. Then, quickly pull the strip off of the skin. Once the hair is gone, you’ll notice your skin will feel smoother and softer than if you had shaved it — this is because the wax is infused with coconut and marulas oils, which hydrate skin from within.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type of Wax: </strong>Soft<strong> </strong>|<strong> Includes: </strong>Wax strips<strong> </strong>|<strong> Treatments per Kit: </strong>34</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-beginners-starpil-standard-hard-wax-kit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Beginners</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Starpil Wax Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Starpil Standard Hard Wax Kit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wV-NCYjQyrSH3FqTekCe_gMtDRo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/starpil-standard-hard-wax-kit-2d010fcc79ec4fb98cb3f6e061303e5e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Starpil Wax</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This kit comes with a wax warmer that can hold up to one pound of wax.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The wax can crack if it is not heated properly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Take full-body hair removal into your own hands with the help of this complete waxing kit. It comes with an easy-to-use wax warmer, your choice of hard wax (pink, blue, or black film beads), pre- and post-wax care products, and 100 wooden spatulas. This kit is ideal for beginners since it comes with all the tools needed to wax any (and every!) inch of your body. Additionally, the wax warmer is easy to adjust, and the pre-and post-wax gels and oils help to protect skin. We suggest setting the wax warmer temperature to about 175 degrees and keeping an eye on the wax while it melts. Once the wax has a honey-like consistency, it will be ready to use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I recommend the brand Starpil [for beginners],” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Amelia Bolten</a>, a licensed beauty professional and CEO and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Mealz Beauty</a>. “Be sure to purchase the Blue Film Beads to go with it – they give the user a better consistency when melting and make the process seamless when applying to the skin.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type of Wax: </strong>Hard<strong> </strong>|<strong> Includes: </strong>Pre- and post-wax care bundle, Hard wax warmer, Wooden spatulas |<strong> Treatments per Kit: </strong>100+</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-coarse-hair-wax-bare-coconut-wax></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Coarse Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wax Bare Coconut Wax</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Wax Bare Coconut Wax" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SwuS-Eegh_cWWuG1ShfNC0c04UE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/wax-bare-coconut-wax-70f8ca590f5046b9a4af7073bb18da50.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Wax Bare</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This wax is made to bond quickly to hair (not skin), meaning it’s suitable for sensitive areas.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>This product only comes with wax and not additional tools like a wax warmer or strips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“For coarse hair, I recommend the brand WaxBare.

(Luckily, you can find <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">wax warmers for about $20</a> online.)

You can mix the [wax] beads around to ensure your product is melting evenly.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Step 2:</strong> “Once the beads are completely melted, you can turn the pot down to 50-70 degrees,” she continues. “After letting that cool, check the consistency by picking some wax up with a stick and twirling it like you would with spaghetti on a fork. If it falls off the stick instantly it’s too hot. If you can twirl it and it moves with your motion, you’re ready to wax.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Before waxing, test an area of your skin to make sure you are not allergic. Once you’ve done that, prep the area you want to wax. You can do this by washing the area with soap and water or by using a pre-wax treatment if your kit came with one.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once the skin is dry, apply the wax to the area. “Always apply wax with the direction of hair growth,” says Buldini. Hold the skin tight with one hand and pull the end of the wax strip with the other. You’ll remove in the opposite direction of your hair growth. This should be done in one fluid motion — don’t start and stop pulling on the strip. Place your hand over the waxed area immediately after, this can stop the sting.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once hair is removed, apply a post-care lotion or oil. Natural remedies like aloe vera or tea tree oil can reduce inflammation, while products that contain glycolic and salicylic acid can help to prevent ingrown hairs.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Wax Type:</strong> Hard and soft (also referred to as cream) waxes are the two main wax types that are used when it comes to at-home kits.To determine what kind of wax is best for you, consider a few things: First, is your hair thin, medium, or coarse? Next, which area are you looking to wax? Is it a small area like your upper lip or is it a big area like your legs? If you have thin hair and are looking to wax a small area, it’s best to use soft wax. This kind of wax often comes on pre-waxed strips that are made for areas on the face. On the other hand, if you have thick, coarse hair, and want to wax an area like your legs, it’s recommended to use hard wax since it wraps about the hair follicles at a cooler temperature, which can be gentler when removing stubborn hair. For this, a waxing kit is best since you can use temperature-controlled wax.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Skin Sensitivity:</strong> Be aware of how sensitive your skin is before waxing it. While at-home waxing is convenient and more affordable than going to a salon, sometimes it’s best to see a professional if your skin is extremely sensitive. “Waxing can cause post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, which is basically hyperpigmentation caused by trauma,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Nidah Barber-Raymond</a>, a licensed esthetician and founder of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Peel Connection</a>. To avoid this, look for waxes with safe, nourishing ingredients like castor seed or almond oils.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Kit Inclusions: </strong>Waxing goes beyond just a wax or a strip. You may require a skin-prepping ointment or a post-wax soothing gel, and many of these kits offer just that. As you shop for a waxing kit, consider what’s included in the full package, including how many strips or spatchulas, cleansing wipes, aloe cream, or anything else your skin needs.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the difference between hard and soft wax?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hard and soft wax are not drastically different from each other, but they do offer unique features that might make you more inclined to use one over the other. “Hard wax tends to be the more painless wax method,” explains Bolten. “However, it requires a pot to melt the beads or blocks down. In my opinion, you get a better wax [with hard wax] because it really sticks to the hairs and doesn’t leave wax behind.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On the other hand, soft wax is better to use if you need a quick fix. “Soft wax works great if you’re looking for more convenience – for instance, if you’re in a time crunch and need a fast wax. It can only be applied to the same area of the body once, but it does have great consistency making spreading easier, which means [you can get] larger areas in less time. This wax also works well on all hair types but not necessarily on all skin types, so be careful when using,” adds Bolten.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How should you prepare your skin for waxing?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s important to prepare your skin properly before waxing by exfoliating 24 hours before. “When preparing your skin for a wax you want to make sure you have a good cleanser to clean the area of any oils, lotions, or makeup,” says Bolten. “I advise my clients that if they are on any medications, they should be checking with their doctor before placing any product on their skin. If the area being waxed tends to have moisture, always apply talc-free powder or cornstarch powder to ensure the wax is sticking.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How should you care for your skin following a wax?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After waxing, take the necessary steps to keep your hair-free skin soft, smooth, and healthy. “Be mindful of sensitivity — hold off on working out, hot yoga, swimming, hot tubs, spray tan, [and] sex for 24 hours,” advises Buldini. “Always hydrate and use your favorite body lotion or oil.” Additionally, if you are waxing an area on your face, be sure to use sunscreen to keep the area protected.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After waxing, take the necessary steps to keep your hair-free skin soft, smooth, and healthy. “Be mindful of sensitivity — hold off on working out, hot yoga, swimming, hot tubs, spray tan, [and] sex for 24 hours,” advises Buldini. “Always hydrate and exfoliate waxed skin.

Luckily, cleaning out a wax warmer is quick and easy. First, melt any leftover wax that is still in the warmer. (It’s much easier to clean out liquid wax than it is to clean out hardened wax.) Once the wax has been melted, unplug the warmer and let the wax cool for a few minutes. Then, transport the melted wax into a heat-resistant container (you can do this by using a silicone spatula to scrape out the wax). If you want to reuse the wax, we suggest storing it in a tin container. On the other hand, if you want to discard the leftover wax, it’s best to pour it into a heat-resistant container and then throw that away.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once the wax has been removed from the warmer and the warmer is completely cool, wipe down the inside of the it with a wet paper towel. To clean out stubborn wax, dampen a paper towel or cloth with isopropyl alcohol and rub the inside of the warmer. Then let it dry.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lauren Harano</a> has been contributing to InStyle since August 2022, covering a wide range of beauty topics.
