For most of his career, he was in the top ten pounds for pound fighters but lost his place on the list in 2017 after losing four consecutive times.</p><p>Anthony Pettis became a professional mixed martial artist in December 2007. Since then the MMA expert has fought 28 professional fights with 21 wins and 7 defeats. Since 2011 he is one of the most popular and popular athletes in the UFC and currently holds 13th place in the UFC’s lightweight class.</p><h2><strong>Anthony Pettis: Biography</strong></h2><p>Anthony Paul Pettis was born on January 27, 1987, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son of Eugene Pettis Jnr. and Annette Garcia. His father, Eugene, died prematurely in a robbery on November 12, 2003. Anthony spent his formative years on the south side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with his two brothers, Ray and Sergio Pettis. The UFC fighter is of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent, but his grandfather, Eugene Perez, changed her surname from Perez to Pettis to avoid unnecessary discrimination.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Anthony-pettis.jpg><p>Anthony Pettis attended Dominican High School for his secondary education. The young athlete began boxing and taekwondo training at the tender age of five and took up wrestling during his college years. By the time he started MMA training at the age of 18, he was already a black belt in third-degree taekwondo. Anthony also completed training in Capoeira.</p><p>Besides his MMA career, Anthony Pettis also has a good feeling for business. In cooperation with his business partners Scott Joffe and Duke Roufus, he opened a Roufusport MMA Academy and Showtime Sports Bar in Milwaukee. He is also the owner of a barbershop, which is also located in Milwaukee.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Katinka Hosszu Biography and Family Facts, Why Did She Split From Husband?</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Family: Brothers</strong></h2><p>Anthony Pettis grew up with two brothers – Sergio Pettis and Ray Pettis. Remarkable among the two is Sergio Pettis, a stubborn fighter in the flyweight division of the UFC. Born on August 18, 1993, Sergio is certainly a force to be reckoned with, much like his brother. Out of 20 fights, he has won 17 and lost only 3. Sergio also has the Taekwondo Black Belt 2.</p><h2><strong><span class=amp-wp-inline-85d39f12cef02cacfbabc726ed0de025>Personal Life: Wife, Girlfriend</span></strong></h2><figure id=attachment_32446 class="wp-caption aligncenter amp-wp-inline-086b83d24e4412010a175ea3dba11ca3" aria-describedby=caption-attachment-32446></figure><p>Pettis has no woman in his life at the moment. The current woman in Anthony’s life is Lisette Gadzuric, the ex-wife of the famous basketball player Daniel Gadzuric. Although there have been several photos of the couple on social media for some time now, it is not known exactly when they started meeting or how long they have been together. Lisette once shared a romantic picture she took with her boyfriend on Valentine’s Day 2017, thanking him for making her feel loved, beautiful, strong, and smart.</p><p>The couple in love seems to never miss an opportunity to share their relationship on social media. They are consistently updating their followers with photos of their romantic vacations and their numerous dinner dates. The captions of the offices usually range from how blessed they are to have found each other to how much they miss each other when they are separated. What is obvious is that the duo shares a special bond with each other, even though it is not the first attempt to love either of them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Anthony-Pettis-with-girlfriend-Lisette-Gadzuric.jpg><p>Anthony Pettis used to date Alexandra Cartagena, and the two share a daughter named Aria, who was born on July 9, 2011.
