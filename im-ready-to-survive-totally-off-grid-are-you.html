And no, not everyone wants to hoard supplies, buy random gear, or stash emergency food, but modern tech gadgets can provide you with several options when necessary.</p><p>While I won't be going over all the gear I have ready and waiting, here are a few things everyone should stock up on or have at home. That way, you'll be better prepared to survive off-grid or handle a natural disaster.</p><h2 id=portable-on-demand-power>Portable On-Demand Power</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bd3605d1.jpg> Cory Gunther / Review Geek<p>Access to on-demand power is important during an emergency or natural disaster.

Take advantage of the flashlight, and use it to track the time, days, weeks, or months. Plus, during the initial stages of a natural disaster, you could use Google or Apple Maps for navigation using GPS, even without cell service, not to mention the compass app.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I own several different power stations, from highly portable 500W models to options delivering over 2400W of power.

Eventually, cars won't be all that useful, and if you're living off-grid, a gas station could be hours away. You'll still want some form of transportation, and that's where an <a href=#>electric bike could come in handy</a>.</p><p>Obviously, a regular pedal bike (or a horse) is a great tool for the apocalypse and never needs a recharge. Still, with so many electric bike options available, like my full-suspension <a href=#>fat tire Super73-RX</a> shown above, you might as well take advantage of the latest technology.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>RadRunner Electric Bike Review: Perfect for Your First E-Bike</a></span></p><p>Electric bikes are fast and easy to ride, can help you preserve energy, and most of them come with cargo racks making them great for transportation.

I'm not talking about outrunning zombies, but you'll want to be able to navigate off-grid with more than a bike only built to handle paved roads.</p><h2 id=waterproof-backpack>Waterproof Backpack</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ceb7825e.jpg> <a href=#>Amazon</a><p>You've probably heard the term "bug-out bag" or "go-bag." They're an absolutely fantastic item everyone should have. One backpack full of essentials to start a fire, defend yourself, MRE (meals ready to eat), an emergency blanket, or patch up an injury with a first-aid kit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Again, I could go on and on about some of the things I have in my go-bag, but everyone is different with their wants, needs, preferences, or ideas. What's important to my bag might not be for you. However, we all can agree that a good waterproof backpack is highly recommended. Something that can store enough gear to last a weekend, or an entire week, all while keeping the contents organized and dry. Here are a few excellent options from our sister site LifeSavvy.</p><h2 id=a-few-other-random-items>A Few Other Random Items</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/9b282230.jpg> <a href=#>Amazon</a><p>You can find survival gear or off-grid supplies everywhere if you know where to look. And thanks to technology, there are all sorts of useful items that not everyone thinks about. For example, the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">BioLite Camp Stove</a>&nbsp;runs on nothing but a little firewood, which you can use to boil water, and it'll also recharge your phone or an emergency flashlight. It's not the fastest charger, but every little bit counts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>3 of the Best Emergency Radios for the Intelligent Pessimist</a></span></p><p>I also have a <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">collapsible solar-powered lantern</a> that'll give me light anywhere, even when the power goes out. It's small enough to pack in my go-bag yet expands to fill a room or tent with light. It has a USB-A port for charging other devices, but your best bet is to use it primarily as a light source.</p><p>And we can't forget fire. It'll keep you warm, the animals away, and let you safely boil water or cook dinner. I can start a fire anywhere without tools, thanks to some training during my younger years, but not everyone has that skill set. However, you can buy a <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">USB-C rechargeable electric lighter</a> that'll never run out of lighter fuel or butane. Charge it with the stove above, a solar panel, or your battery bank, and you'll be able to start a fire in seconds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's also a wise idea to have an emergency radio, and if you've ever watched The Walking Dead, you know what I'm talking about.
