It entails subjecting your body to immense stress for 30 minutes, then resting for a few seconds and then continuing with the exercises. Essentially, you will be doing high-intensity resistance and aerobic exercises for six days a week.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/544bad48a42792ec.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Will Willis from Forged in Fire?

These include sequences that focus on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">explosive movements</a> (lower-body plyometrics), abs, cardio, upper body strength, and recovery workout. They consist of:</p><ul><li>The Fit Test</li><li>Plyometric Cardio Circuit</li><li>Cardio Power and Resistance</li><li>Cardio Recovery</li><li>Pure Cardio</li></ul><p class=align-left>The second phase has four different exercises. They include:</p><ul><li>Max Interval Circuit</li><li>Max Interval Plyo</li><li>Max Cardio Conditioning</li><li>Max Recovery</li></ul><p class=align-left>Each workout starts with a warm-up. You will perform different movements like jumping jacks, jogging, and jump rope. After the warm-up, you will do some stretching.

The moves you will be making are variations of plyometrics, pushups, jumping jacks, squats, sprints, lunges, and kickboxing moves.</p><h2>How long is the Insanity workout?</h2><p class=align-left>The insanity workout takes 60 days to complete. In these sixty days, you will do two phases of the workout as described above. Because you will be training for six days in a week, you will break down your exercises in phase one into several minutes as follows:</p><ul><li>The Fit Test – 26 minutes</li><li>Plyometric Cardio Circuit – 42 minutes</li><li>Cardio Power and Resistance – 40 minutes</li><li>Cardio Recovery – 33 minutes</li><li>Pure Cardio – 39 minutes</li></ul><p class=align-left>For phase two, the following is the length of each exercise you will be doing.</p><ul><li>Max Interval Circuit – 60 minutes</li><li>Max Interval Plyo – 56 minutes</li><li>Max Cardio Conditioning – 48 minutes</li><li>Max Recovery – 47 minutes</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/09d8f526289ad4bf.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 13 ways to induce period naturally</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is clear from these numbers that the intensity of the insanity workout increases in phase two.

But because you will be doing it at home, and it is hard to complete, it can be difficult to measure how effective the program is. If your goal is to lose weight, these are the effects you are likely to get in one month of training.</p><h3>Week one</h3><p class=align-left>You are less likely to lose weight in your first week of insanity workout. Several things can contribute to this.</p><ul><li>Poor diet</li><li>Busy monthly cycle</li><li>Your body’s adjustment to the program</li></ul><p class=align-left>To start losing weight or move the scale higher, you need a better eating routine in week two and commit to the workout. As for week one results, you will notice an increase in body definition.</p><h3>Week two</h3><p class=align-left>If you are committed to the workout and have a proper diet, you will notice changes by week two. You should drop at least three pounds at this point. If you are a woman, you should see vertical lines on your abdominal external oblique muscle. Also, your upper abs should start to flatten and rest close to the body.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/39da5d513fe954c2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best action games to download</span></p></a><h3>Week three</h3><p class=align-left>Your body should lighten up by week three. You should have lost at least six pounds by this time. Also, your muscles should be visible even when not flexing. However, this will depend on how committed you were to the fitness program and your diet plan.</p><h3>Week four</h3><p class=align-left>You should see some significant changes to your body in week four. By now, you should have lost six to eight pounds of weight by this time.</p><p class=align-left>Generally, diet and commitment to the workout are essential in losing weight. If you do not have a balanced diet, you will be exercising and adding fat at the same time. That means you will not be making any signs of progress.

Your body loses fat when you burn fat. At the same time, you need to take in less energy to allow the body to burn more fat. The body draws off triglycerides from fat stores and breaks them down until they can be used as fuel.</p><p class=align-left>The process should frequently happen to ensure the fat cells shrink and no longer have many triglycerides. At this point, your waistline should get smaller. Remember that the vital part of the process is burning more energy and doing lots of cardiovascular exercises. So, how does insanity workout contribute to all this?</p><p class=align-left>The insanity workout employs circuit training, plyometrics, and interval training to increase heart rate and maintain it for the duration of the exercises. Since you will be losing weight, the strength exercises incorporated in the workout helps your body to retain a lean muscle mass.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs6nvuu5di8m1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Which are the best gyms in Nairobi and what are the prices?</span></p></a><h2>What about diet?</h2><p class=align-left>The insanity workout is not all about high-intensity exercises. It also includes a diet plan. A diet plan helps to fuel your fitness exercises and lose fat. Its focus is to ensure you eat enough carbs that will boost your endurance. Also, you will need lean proteins to help repair your muscles.</p><p class=align-left>Doing an intense exercise increases your appetite. But you need a proper diet because an unadvised snack can make your entire fitness plan look useless. To maximize the amount of fat you lose from doing the workouts, ensure to eat a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">low-fat diet</a>.</p><p class=align-left>A crucial point to note is that the insanity workout is not for everybody. Your physical fitness must be good in shape or condition. The workout keeps the heart rate within 80-90% of the body’s maximum heart rate throughout the exercises. As such, you must consult with your doctor first before you start the program. You must first complete a fit test before you start the program. If you cannot finish it, the intensity of the workout will be too much for you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs7uv7h88lc31.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>An Honest rev.com Review for Kenyans</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> 10 healthy salad recipes vegetarians will love</p><h2>How many calories do you burn in an insanity workout?</h2><p class=align-left>The number of calories the body burns while doing the insanity workout will depend on many factors. These include:</p><h3>Current weight</h3><p class=align-left>Your current weight will affect the number of calories you will burn doing the insanity workout. If you weigh 150 pounds, for example, you will lose about 100 calories if you do the exercises for 15-20 minutes.</p><p class=align-left>If you weigh more, your body will need more energy to function. Heavier people will burn more calories doing this exercise than lighter people. The same case applies if you are overweight or you have a higher muscle mass.</p><h3>Age</h3><p class=align-left>When a person ages, the number of muscles in their body tends to decrease. That means they have more fat that accounts for their total body weight. As such, the number of calories they can burn while doing the insanity workout is low because of less muscle tissue.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs49vqjoj7ilp.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 Really Cool Activities To Do With Friends Locally</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When you start losing your muscle tissue, your metabolism will slow down. To avoid this, you need to maintain your muscle tissue. You can achieve this by doing strength-training workouts at least three days a week.</p><h3>Maximum heart rate</h3><p class=align-left>The topic on maximum heart rate and calorie burn when doing the insanity workout is complex. If your heart rate is high, the heart will not have enough time to keep up with the exercises. For example, it is difficult to go beyond 80% of your MHR (maximal heart rate) and maintain it for more than one minute. It is only possible if you are an athlete who has conditioned the body for it.</p><p class=align-left>Counting how many calories the body can burn per one unit of time will vary drastically. Assume that you are exercising at 80 per cent of your <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">MHR</a>, but you can only do it for sixty seconds. That means if you take your MHR over 300 seconds, it will vary with that of an athlete who exercises for the full 300 seconds. But if you maintain your exercises for 300 seconds, you will burn more calories if your MHR is between 60 and 70%.</p><h3>Gender – male or female</h3><p class=align-left>If a man and a woman do the insanity workout at the same time, the man will lose more calories than the woman. Men have lean muscle tissues that help them to burn more calories than fat. On average, a woman has between 6 and 11% more body fat than a man.</p><p class=align-left>The extra fat helps them during pregnancy. Even if a woman takes in fewer calories, her average body fat will still be more than that of a man. Because men have larger body sizes, they will burn more calories than women.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Best fitness quotes for motivation and success</p><h3>Muscle mass</h3><p class=align-left>A pound of muscle and pound of muscle have the same weight. But their energy requirements are different. If you have more muscles, you will burn more calories than fat when doing the insanity workout.</p><p class=align-left>If you are heavily muscular, it means you have a higher basal metabolic rate. That also means your body burns more calories even when at rest. One pound of muscle can help you burn around ten calories.</p><h3>Genes</h3><p class=align-left>Genes can affect your weight in many ways. If your body is genetically predisposed to adding weight, you will have a difficult time trying to control your hunger. No matter how much time you put into doing the insanity workout, you will find yourself eating unhealthy foods. For example, you will eat a cookie which tends to have more calories. You will be burning more calories but retaking them through the foods you eat.</p><h3>Rest period</h3><p class=align-left>Part of the insanity workout program is to allow the body to rest. Your rest period is essential because it determines the number of calories you will burn. For example, you will burn around <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">140 calories per hour while eating</a> and 75 calories while reading or watching TV.</p><p class=align-left>Any insanity workout review you read online will inform you that this is one of the most effective fitness exercises on the market. Any fitness program you begin that your body is not used to will have positive effects on it. Since the body is not used to the physical stimulus of the exercises, it will be forced to change and adapt. If you are not careful, it will break down through injury.</p><p class=align-left>When you start the insanity workout, you will see positive changes. But for this to happen, you also have a proper diet plan. That is why the workout also comes with a diet plan to ensure the body gets the proper nutrition and fuel to enable it to continue with the exercises.</p><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p class=align-left>The information in this article is not intended or implied to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.
