Her stunning performance in the long-running television series has earned her much critical acclaim over the years, including an ALMA Award in 2011. The talented actress has also earned several credits on the big screen, including The Last Rites of Ransom Pride in 2010, Biopic The 33 in 2015, and The Dovekeepers (2015).</p><p>Read on to learn more about Is Cote De Pablo Married, What is She Doing Now? Her Net Worth, Husband</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who Is Cote De Pablo? Age, Bio</strong></h2><p>The multi-talented actress was born on November 12, 1979, in Santiago, Chile, as María José de Pablo Fernández. Her parents are Francisco de Pablo and María Olga Fernández, and she grew up with a sister, Andrea, and a brother, Francisco. She moved to the United States of America at the age of 10 when her mother got a job with a Spanish-language television station in Miami, Florida. There she attended Arvida Middle School and also studied musical theater at the New World School of the Arts. As a fifth-grader, Pablo changed her often mispronounced first name “María José” to “Coté”, the latter being a common Chilean nickname for the former.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Martin Henderson Wife, Age, Height, Parents, Family, Bio</a></strong></p><p>At the age of 15, Cote De Pablo co-starred in several episodes of the Latin American talk show Control (1994-95) alongside former Entertainment Tonight host Carlos Ponce. She completed her college education at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She studied music and theater. During her studies, she performed in several plays, which she finally completed in 2000.</p><p>After graduating, Pablo moved to New York to begin her acting career. While working as a waitress to make a living, she acted in theater productions and commercials and also got smaller roles in many television series. She later landed a spot in the main cast of the legal drama series The Jury in 2004, but the series was short-lived.</p><p>In 2005 Pablo had her big breakthrough in the career-defining role of Ziva David in the 3rd season of the successful police drama series NCIS. She portrayed the character in 8 seasons of the series, from 2005 to 2013. Among several other awards, the talented actress won the 2011 ALMA Award for Favourite TV Actress – Leading Role in a Drama with 4 nominations. She was also nominated for 4 Imagen Awards between 2006 and 2011.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What Is She Doing Now?</strong></h2><p>After leaving NCIS, Cote De Pablo starred in the 2015 biographical film The 33, based on the 2010 Chilean mining accident. She also starred in the two-part TV mini-series The Dovekeepers (2015). Cote also played the lead role in a 2016 telefilm opposite Jack Davenport.</p><p>The talented actress is willing to explore the aspect behind the scenes of film and television. In August 2018, she was named executive producer in an upcoming CBS crime drama MIA alongside NCIS co-star Michael Weatherly.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Joc Pederson Wife, Brother, Girlfriend, Salary, Biography</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What Is Her Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>Although she has yet to get a taste of blockbuster movies, Cote De Pablo has done very well as an actress since the beginning of her career in the early 2000s. During her final years at NCIS, she earned up to $120,000 per episode. While most of her wealth came from her flourishing acting career, Pablo has also signed massive sponsorship deals over the years, especially with cosmetics and beauty brands. Her net worth is set at a conservative estimate of $6 million as of 2024.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is Cote De Pablo Married? Husband</strong></h2><p>It is known that Cote De Pablo is unmarried, but it remains unclear whether she is in a relationship.
